# Doppler-Shift Attenuation Method

## Purpose

DSAM extracts short excited-state lifetimes from the Doppler-broadened γ-ray line shape produced while recoils slow in target/backing material. Forward and backward detector angles provide complementary velocity sensitivity.

## Inputs and Assumptions

- reaction kinematics, recoil velocity histories and detector geometry;
- stopping powers and material thickness/profile;
- transition placement, contaminant peaks and detector response;
- direct and side-feeding intensities, lifetimes or effective quadrupole moments;
- branching/mixing information for conversion from lifetime to `B(E2)` or `Q_t`.

## Analysis Chain

Singh 2016 uses LINESHAPE Monte Carlo histories at `0.002-ps` time steps and fits forward/backward gated spectra simultaneously. Ziegler and shell-corrected Northcliffe–Schilling stopping powers are treated as alternative prescriptions; central values are averaged and the larger uncertainty retained.

## What It Can Establish

- source-specific mean lifetimes or limits in the line-shape sensitivity window;
- side-feeding-sensitive `Q_t` after a rotational conversion;
- angle/stopping-prescription consistency and contaminant diagnostics.

## What It Cannot Establish Alone

- intrinsic γ softness/rigidity, microscopic configuration or nuclear chirality;
- a unique lifetime if side feeding, stopping or contaminant structure is underconstrained;
- partner-band electromagnetic equality from a single measured sequence;
- direct intrinsic `Q0` without rotational-geometry assumptions.

## Known Limitations

Thick targets broaden the production-depth/velocity distribution. Stopping powers, side-feeding cascades and long feeding times can dominate the systematic budget. A line that is fully shifted or shows no significant angle-dependent shape yields only a limit or complementary RDDS bracket.

[[wang-2023-experimental-studies-nuclear-chirality-china]] adds a review-level statistical caution: the common practice of varying one nuisance parameter at a time and adding lifetime shifts in quadrature does not represent correlations, asymmetric intervals or physical limits. Its cited Bayesian/MCMC alternative is a useful method lead, not yet direct Wiki evidence, because the underlying Sun et al. 2023 analysis has not been ingested.

[[bark-2024-investigations-nuclear-chirality-ithembalabs]] describes the AFRODITE use of forward/backward line shapes and COMPA/GAMMA/SHAPE Monte Carlo histories that include slowing, feeding and statistical/collective cascades. Its `106Ag` example is secondary to the original Lieder 2014 experiment and should not substitute for that source's fit/systematic details.
