# Multiple Chiral Doublet Bands of Identical Configuration in `103Rh`

## Bibliographic Record

Physical Review Letters 113, 032501 (2014), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.032501`. The protected BibTeX key is `kuti_2014_MultipleChiral`.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: all five PDF pages; experimental setup, partial level scheme and DCO logic; Bands 1–6 identity; same-spin separations, alignments and experimental `B(M1)/B(E2)` ratios; constrained CDFT, TAC-CDFT and PRM inputs/results; limitations and conclusion.
- Not covered: raw coincidence matrices, efficiency calibration details, the complete `103Rh` level scheme, or the cited 2004/2006 `103Rh` spectroscopy and 2011 PRM papers in full.
- Coverage caveats: parity assignments use an explicit electromagnetic-character assumption; the paper does not tabulate lifetime-separated absolute strengths; the detailed TAC-CDFT angular-momentum analysis is deferred to a future publication.

## Extracted Pages

- PDF p.1: motivation, experiment and start of spin/parity method.
- PDF p.2: partial level scheme, DCO values and Bands 3–6 links.
- PDF p.3: alignment grouping, constrained CDFT and TAC-CDFT configuration/shape results.
- PDF p.4: PRM inputs, energies and `B(M1)/B(E2)` comparison.
- PDF p.5: alignment discrepancy, same-configuration MχD conclusion and references.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

The paper asks whether chirality survives not only a change of configuration but also an increase of intrinsic excitation within one configuration. It therefore searches beyond the lowest two bands of a configuration and tests whether the third and fourth negative-parity bands form a second chiral doublet alongside the yrast pair (PDF pp.1,3-5).

## Method and Design Logic

- High-fold Gammasphere coincidences extend known Bands 3/6 and establish new Bands 4/5 (PDF pp.1-2; Figs.1-2).
- DCO ratios classify stretched quadrupole and dipole links; spin/parity assignments combine those ratios with a stated E2/M1 assumption (PDF pp.1-2).
- Same-spin energy differences, experimental `B(M1)/B(E2)` ratios and Harris-reference alignments group Bands 3/4 and 6/5 (PDF pp.2-3; Figs.3-4).
- Constrained CDFT identifies candidate configurations/shapes, TAC-CDFT follows them with rotation, and PRM compares four quantum bands and transition ratios with the observations (PDF pp.3-5; Fig.4).

## Summary

The experiment reports three proposed doublet structures in `103Rh`: positive-parity Bands 1/2 and two negative-parity pairs, Bands 3/4 and Bands 6/5. The two negative pairs are assigned the same effective `πg9/2^-1⊗νh11/2g7/2` configuration and interpreted as yrast and excited chiral doublets. This is the paper's first-evidence claim for same-configuration MχD. The durable experimental result is four mutually linked negative-parity bands with small pairwise separations and similar ratios/alignments; identical configuration, aplanar geometry and robustness against intrinsic excitation remain model-supported interpretations with visible PRM and frozen-core limitations.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- `96Zr(11B,4n)103Rh` at `40 MeV`, LBNL 88-inch cyclotron.
- Enriched self-supporting `96Zr` target, `500 μg/cm²`.
- Gammasphere; about `9×10^8` four-and-higher-fold events; RADWARE 2D/3D sorting.
- With a stretched-quadrupole gate, `R_DCO≈1.0` and `≈0.5` are expected for stretched quadrupole and dipole transitions.
- Alignment reference: `K=1/2`, Harris `J0=7 ħ²/MeV`, `J1=15.7 ħ⁴/MeV³`.
- CDFT/TAC-CDFT effective interaction: PC-PK1. PRM uses `γ=20°`, `β=0.29/0.26` and moments of inertia `23/25 ħ²/MeV` for positive/negative parity; negative-parity calculation uses Coriolis attenuation `ξ=0.85`.

## Key Results

| ID | Statement | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| KU14-1 | The experiment accumulated about `9×10^8` four-and-higher-fold Gammasphere events following `96Zr(11B,4n)` at `40 MeV`. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.1-2 | true |
| KU14-2 | Known Bands 3 and 6 were extended to `39/2` and `35/2`, and new Bands 4 and 5 were established through triple coincidences. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.2; Figs.1-2 | true |
| KU14-3 | The `674/1007-keV` links from Band 5 to B and `574/700-keV` links from Band 4 to 6 have quadrupole-like DCO values, while `396/391-keV` 4→3 and 5→6 links have dipole-like values. | method-result | direct | PDF p.2 | true |
| KU14-4 | Negative parity for Bands 4/5 additionally assumes that comparable quadrupole/dipole decays to a band are E2/M1; DCO alone does not determine electric versus magnetic character. | evidence-boundary | direct | PDF pp.1-2 | true |
| KU14-5 | Bands 3–6 are four mutually linked negative-parity `ΔI=1` bands; same-spin differences are about `300 keV` for 3/4 and `100 keV` for 6/5, with similar experimental `B(M1)/B(E2)` values. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.2-3; Figs.1,4 | true |
| KU14-6 | All four bands have alignment near `9ħ`; the strongest pairwise similarities are 3/4 and 5/6, motivating the yrast 3/4 and excited 6/5 grouping. | derived-observable | direct | PDF p.3; Fig.3 | true |
| KU14-7 | Bands 4 and 6 are sufficiently close that their energy ordering changes with spin, so “yrast/excited” labels describe pair grouping rather than a fixed ordering of every member. | evidence-boundary | direct | PDF p.3 | true |
| KU14-8 | Earlier positive-parity Bands 1/2 retain the proposed `πg9/2^-1⊗ν(h11/2)^2` configuration; this paper's numbering is not explicitly crosswalked to Suzuki 2008's lifetime-measured “Band 3.” | source-crosswalk-boundary | direct | PDF pp.2,4; comparison with Suzuki 2008 | true |
| KU14-9 | Constrained CDFT gives a γ-soft ground-state minimum near `β=0.25, γ=20°`, a positive-parity candidate near `β=0.29, γ=11°`, and two triaxial negative-parity candidates. | model-result | indirect | PDF p.3 | true |
| KU14-10 | TAC-CDFT selects an effective negative-parity `πg9/2^-1⊗νh11/2g7/2` description, with neutron angular momenta mainly along the short axis and the proton hole mainly along the long axis. | model-result | indirect | PDF p.3 | true |
| KU14-11 | The TAC-CDFT geometry discussion is incomplete in this Letter because calculation details are explicitly deferred to a forthcoming publication. | model-boundary | direct | PDF p.3 | true |
| KU14-12 | Positive-parity PRM reproduces energies and similar ratios, while the slower experimental ratio decrease is attributed to the frozen-rotor approximation; a prior PRM study supplies the vibration→near-static→vibration evolution. | model-result | indirect | PDF p.4; Fig.4 | true |
| KU14-13 | Negative-parity PRM produces two doublets and reasonably reproduces Bands 3–6, but Bands 5/6 lie about `200 keV` too high, attributed to missing complex correlations. | model-result | indirect | PDF p.4; Fig.4 | true |
| KU14-14 | The sharp alignment increase of Bands 5/6 near `ħω=0.45 MeV` is not reproduced and is attributed to the frozen core. | model-discrepancy | direct | PDF p.5; Fig.3 | true |
| KU14-15 | The authors interpret weak ratio staggering in 3/4 as chiral vibration and reproduce a 5/6 staggering near `I=15.5`, but the ratios are not lifetime-separated absolute strengths for all four bands. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.4-5; Fig.4 | true |
| KU14-16 | The same-configuration MχD and robustness-against-intrinsic-excitation conclusions depend on assigning both negative-parity pairs to the same effective configuration. | evidence-boundary | indirect | PDF pp.4-5 | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

| Structure | Parity / role | Assignment and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Bands 1/2 | positive-parity earlier candidate | `πg9/2^-1⊗ν(h11/2)^2`; PRM-supported chiral-vibrational evolution; direct crosswalk to Suzuki's Band-3 lifetime label unresolved |
| Bands 3/4 | negative-parity yrast candidate pair | first two bands of effective `πg9/2^-1⊗νh11/2g7/2`; ≈`300-keV` separation |
| Bands 6/5 | negative-parity excited candidate pair | third/fourth bands of the same assigned configuration; ≈`100-keV` separation; PRM energy/alignment discrepancies |
| Bands A/B | previously known reference bands | constrained CDFT agrees with earlier low-quasiparticle configuration assignments; not part of the three chiral pairs |

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- Similar energies, ratios and alignments can establish related rotational structures without directly measuring handedness.
- The identical-configuration conclusion depends on CDFT/TAC-CDFT/PRM mapping rather than a model-independent configuration observable.
- The PRM uses fixed deformation, a frozen rotor/core, a single-j Hamiltonian and fitted inertias/attenuation; the observed discrepancies expose those approximations.
- Experimental ratios do not replace absolute lifetimes and matrix elements for both members of both negative-parity pairs.
- Positive-pair comparison across Suzuki 2008 and Kuti 2014 requires a source-level band-number crosswalk not supplied in Kuti's text.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | Audit item | Agent judgment | Evidence / locator | review_status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The strongest new fact is a four-band negative-parity manifold grouped into two closely related pairs; same-configuration MχD is the joint experimental-model interpretation. | KU14-2 to KU14-7, KU14-9/10/13 | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | Assumptions | Parity, identical configuration and handed geometry depend respectively on an E2/M1 assumption and model assignments. | KU14-4, KU14-9 to KU14-11 | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Failure condition | Different configurations, strong configuration mixing or a nonchiral four-band collective solution would invalidate the robustness claim without erasing the observed bands. | KU14-13/14/16 | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Reverse test | Measure lifetimes/mixing ratios throughout Bands 3–6 and compare a dynamical model that treats shape/core fluctuations with explicit nonchiral alternatives. | Full paper | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Cross-source identity | Preserve Suzuki's one-sided lifetime result without assigning it to Kuti Band 1 or 2 until the earlier Ref.19/Ref.14 schemes are directly crosswalked. | KU14-8 | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research decision | Store three candidate pairs, but reserve the MχD-identical-configuration label for the two negative-parity pairs. | Full paper | unreviewed |

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Effect: `supports` an experimental-model case for same-configuration MχD and `limits` it through assignment, absolute-strength and model-dynamics gaps.
- Persistence: create source/experiment and two negative-pair pages; extend the existing positive-pair page, `103Rh`, MχD concept and chirality project.
- Review state: all `KU14-*` and AR claims remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence gate.

## Human Review Triage

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **KU14-4 — parity logic.** Keep the electromagnetic-character assumption separate from the DCO measurements.
- **KU14-8 — band-number crosswalk.** Do not map Suzuki's lifetime Band 3 directly onto Kuti Band 1 or 2 without reading the earlier schemes.
- **KU14-10/11/16 — same-configuration geometry.** Preserve CDFT/TAC-CDFT dependence and the deferred calculation details.
- **KU14-13/14 — model discrepancies.** Retain the `≈200-keV` energy excess and missing alignment jump as active limitations.
- **KU14-15 — ratio semantics.** Do not rewrite plotted `B(M1)/B(E2)` ratios as absolute partner-band matrix elements.
