# Multiphonon longitudinal wobbling in `127Xe`

## Bibliographic Record

Physics Letters B 811, 135854 (2020), DOI `10.1016/j.physletb.2020.135854`; PDF/BibTeX identity checked.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`
- Covered scope: full article, four-band level scheme, DCO/polarization, `δ` branches, relative strengths, energy systematics and phonon assignments.
- Not covered: forthcoming full level scheme and independent recalculation.
- Coverage caveats: key links have contamination/low-statistics limitations; some polarization values are inherited from earlier work.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

- Author-explicit motivation: search for first- and second-phonon longitudinal wobbling in an odd-neutron A≈130 nucleus (PDF pp.1-2).

## Method and Design Logic

- Extend four negative-parity bands; use DCO/polarization and δ branches for adjacent links; compare E_wob and relative transition ratios; infer n_w=0/1/2 and signature-partner roles from the decay topology (PDF pp.2-5, Figs.1-6, Table 1).

## Key Evidence and Reasoning Chain

- Selected E2-dominated links → one-phonon candidate; increasing E_wob → longitudinal label; band-4 placement/decay analogy → second-phonon claim, despite atypical topology and contaminated key evidence.

## Summary

The paper reports “conclusive evidence” for first- and second-phonon longitudinal wobbling and the first odd-neutron LW case. The Wiki preserves substantial claim-specific uncertainties, especially for the 651-keV link and the `n_ω=2` decay pattern.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

`122Sn(9Be,4n)127Xe` at 48 MeV with the IUAC 15UD Pelletron and 14-clover INGA; approximately `9×10^8` twofold-or-higher coincidence events.

## Key Results

| ID | 陈述 | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CH20-1 | Four negative-parity bands were organized into proposed `n_ω=0,1,2` and signature-partner structures. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.2-5, Figs.1-2 and 6 | true |
| CH20-2 | DCO/polarization analysis of the 483-keV link gives large and small `δ` branches; polarization supports the large-E2 solution. | experimental-criterion | direct | PDF pp.3-4, Fig.3, Table 1 | true |
| CH20-3 | The 651-keV link is affected by a contaminant 652-keV transition; its polarization conflicts with a previously reported extreme large-`δ` solution and supports a smaller value. | experimental-criterion | direct | PDF pp.3-4 | true |
| CH20-4 | Band-1/Band-3 links are predominantly E2 and reported E2 fractions increase with spin. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.4-5, Fig.4, Table 1 | true |
| CH20-5 | Increasing `E_wob` is used to classify the proposed sequence as longitudinal. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.4-5, Fig.5 | true |
| CH20-6 | Band 4 is assigned as second-phonon wobbling although its decay pattern is noted to differ from earlier two-phonon cases and resemble a quasi-γ-band pattern in `126Xe`. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.5 | true |
| CH20-7 | Authors conclude first odd-neutron LW and first second-phonon LW observation. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.5, conclusion | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

Bands 1/3/4 are proposed as n_w=0/1/2 and band 2 as signature partner. The 651-keV link and band-4 decay pattern are the critical weak points in that hierarchy.

## Authors' Interpretation

The authors call the result conclusive evidence for odd-neutron and multiphonon longitudinal wobbling; this page retains the transition-specific caveats.

## Model Results

No independent microscopic model section is presented in the source; classification mainly uses measured transition observables, energy trends and structural analogy. Later IBFM work is external competing evidence.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

The paper itself notes nonstandard `n_ω=2` decay topology. Contamination, inherited polarization and branch ambiguity require transition-by-transition review. Later IBFM work provides an alternative description.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | 审核项 | Agent 判断 | Evidence / locator | 审核状态 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CH20-AR-1 | Core reconstruction | One-phonon evidence is stronger than the second-phonon claim, whose atypical topology and contaminated link require separate review. | Key Results and Competing Interpretations above | unreviewed |
| CH20-AR-2 | Assumptions and dependencies | The adopted band identities, mixing-ratio branches, configuration assignments, and model inputs are valid within the stated measured range. | Method/results/model sections cited above | unreviewed |
| CH20-AR-3 | Transfer conditions | Transfer only the measured observables and their explicit conditions; do not transfer the author interpretation without equivalent link and configuration evidence. | Source scope and claim locators above | unreviewed |
| CH20-AR-4 | Failure conditions | Alternative branch, band identity, configuration, or model dependence can weaken the structural label even when the measured transitions remain valid. | Competing Interpretations and Limitations above | unreviewed |
| CH20-AR-5 | Reverse/falsification test | Obtain independent lifetimes/multipolarities or common-input competing-model tests targeted to the stated evidence gap. | Follow-up observables identified by the source/Agent | unreviewed |
| CH20-AR-6 | Research-question decision | Retain the source in the project/synthesis evidence map with the source-local review boundary explicit. | Whole-source assessment | unreviewed |

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Existing Wiki understanding: The Wiki already contained the broader wobbling topic and related candidate map, but not this source in a complete source-local evidence and review structure.
- Effect of this source: supports
- Reason: One-phonon evidence is stronger than the second-phonon claim, whose atypical topology and contaminated link require separate review.
- Persistence decision: project update / synthesis update
- Review state: page-level `human-reviewed`; Key Results claims remain `needs_review: true` for future claim-specific paper use.

## Human Review Triage

Review disposition: the user completed a rough page-level review on 2026-07-25 and accepted the current evidence-calibrated wording without correction. The P0/P1 items below are retained as future strict paper-use verification prompts, not unresolved ingest blockers.

### P0

- `CH20-3`, 651-keV link, PDF pp.3-4 — Evidence: 652-keV contamination and polarization conflict with an earlier extreme δ solution. Agent inference: this transition is not a stable quantitative anchor. User check: subtraction/contamination handling and adopted branch. Risk: contaminated evidence propagates into strengths and band assignment.

### P1

- `CH20-6`, band 4, PDF p.5 — Evidence: the proposed n_w=2 decay topology differs from earlier cases and resembles a quasi-γ pattern. Agent inference: structural analogy does not close the second-phonon claim. User check: all band-4 branches and the alternative interpretation. Risk: an atypical side band may be mislabeled multiphonon wobbling.

### P2/P3

- P1: compare the later IBFM alternative on common observables. P2/P3: metadata/navigation.

## Human Review Record

- 2026-07-25: the user completed a rough review of this source page and accepted its current claims, attribution boundaries, locators and stated limitations without requesting corrections.

## Review Status

Page-level review is complete for this ingest round. Claim-level `needs_review` and Analytical Reconstruction review markers remain unchanged because this was a rough review rather than exhaustive claim-by-claim paper certification.
