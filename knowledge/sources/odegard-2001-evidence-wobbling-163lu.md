# Evidence for the Wobbling Mode in Nuclei

## Bibliographic Record

PRL 86, 5866-5869 (2001), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.5866`. The PDF title, DOI and BibTeX key `odegard_2001_EvidenceWobbling` were checked against the first page before ingest.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`
- Covered scope: full four-page article; experiment, partial level scheme, DCO/angular-distribution/polarization analysis, mixing-ratio branches, relative transition strengths, particle-rotor and cranking comparisons.
- Not covered: cited earlier lifetime datasets and calculation codes were not independently reanalysed.
- Coverage caveats: extracted symbols for `δ`, `γ` and uncertainties were checked against their local PDF context; the exact fit surfaces and detector-response calibration are not reproduced.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

- Author-explicit motivation: establish whether the previously observed `163Lu` TSD2 band is a wobbling excitation built on TSD1 by finding connecting transitions and measuring their electromagnetic character (PDF pp.1-2).

## Method and Design Logic

- Euroball IV coincidence data first extend both bands and establish nine TSD2→TSD1 links; DCO ratios, angular-distribution ratios and linear polarization then constrain multipolarity and the physical mixing-ratio branch (PDF p.2, Figs.1-2).
- Branching ratios and `δ` are converted to relative `B(E2)_out/B(E2)_in` and `B(M1)_out/B(E2)_in`, which are compared with wobbling and cranking-like particle-rotor expectations (PDF pp.3-4, Fig.5, Table I).

## Key Evidence and Reasoning Chain

- Nine links + stable level placement → TSD2 is experimentally connected to TSD1 (PDF p.2, Figs.1-2).
- DCO/angular distributions allow two `δ` branches; positive electric polarization rejects the small-magnitude branch → links are about `90.6(13)%` E2 (PDF p.3).
- Relative transition strengths and similar alignments/moments of inertia agree with the schematic wobbling calculation and disagree strongly with the cranking-like E2 prediction → authors assign TSD2 as `n_w=1` wobbling (PDF pp.3-4, Figs.3-5, Table I).

## Summary

The paper reports direct spectroscopic evidence for E2-dominated TSD2→TSD1 links in `163Lu` and interprets TSD2 as a one-phonon wobbling band. “Established experimentally” is the authors' concluding wording; the Wiki retains the model dependence of the band assignment and the schematic nature of the particle-rotor calculation.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- Reaction: `139La(29Si,5n)163Lu`, `E_beam=152 MeV`.
- Array: Euroball IV at Strasbourg with BGO inner ball.
- Dataset: about `2.4×10^9` events with at least three Compton-suppressed Ge γ rays and at least eight BGO γ rays; 3D/4D coincidence analysis.
- Alignment input: Gaussian magnetic-substate width `σ/I=0.25(2)`, determined from stretched E2 transitions in the relevant spin region (PDF p.2).

## Key Results

| ID | 陈述 | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OD01-1 | TSD2 was extended by about `6ħ` to lower and `4ħ` to higher spin, TSD1 by `10ħ`, and nine TSD2→TSD1 transitions were established. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.2, Figs.1-2 | true |
| OD01-2 | DCO ratios and angular-distribution ratios are consistent with mixed M1/E2 links; the measured electric polarization rejects the small-`abs(δ)` solution. | experimental-criterion | direct | PDF pp.2-3 | true |
| OD01-3 | The adopted mixing ratio is `δ=-3.10^{+0.36}_{-0.44}`, corresponding to `90.6(13)%` E2 and `9.4(13)%` M1. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.3, first paragraph | true |
| OD01-4 | The analysis assigns TSD2 `(π,α)=(+,−1/2)` and confirms stretched E2 character for the in-band transitions in TSD1/TSD2. | experimental-criterion | direct | PDF p.3 | true |
| OD01-5 | TSD2 lies about `250-300 keV` above TSD1 and the separation decreases with spin; their alignments and dynamic moments of inertia are similar. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.3, Figs.1 and 3 | true |
| OD01-6 | Relative `B(E2)_out/B(E2)_in` and `B(M1)_out/B(E2)_in` values agree satisfactorily with the schematic wobbling calculation, whereas the cranking-like solution strongly underpredicts E2 strength. | model-result | direct | PDF p.4, Fig.5 and Table I | true |
| OD01-7 | The authors reject unfavoured-signature and three-quasiparticle alternatives and conclude that TSD2 is `n_w=1` wobbling built on TSD1. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.3-4 | true |
| OD01-8 | The reported `ħω_w/ħω_rot` decreases from about `1.5` to `0.5` with spin, which the authors associate with changing moments of inertia. | model-result | direct | PDF p.4 | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

- TSD1 is the favoured-signature aligned `πi13/2` reference band; TSD2 is connected by `ΔI=1` transitions and assigned the opposite signature.
- TSD1 and TSD2 populations are about 10% and 2.5% of the yrast channel, respectively.
- The partial level scheme and transition energies are given in Fig.1; this page records only the assignment-critical summary rather than duplicating the full scheme.

## Authors' Interpretation

The observed E2-dominated links, relative strengths and similar rotational response are interpreted as the first experimental establishment of nuclear wobbling. This is an attributed conclusion, not a Wiki-wide claim that later debates or alternative formalisms are resolved.

## Model Results

- Ultimate-cranker calculations place the unfavoured `πi13/2` signature partner more than 1 MeV higher, with smaller deformation and larger triaxiality, unlike TSD2.
- A predicted two-quasineutron configuration is also too high and should carry about `2ħ` extra alignment.
- The particle-rotor calculation with an aligned `i13/2` proton reproduces the qualitative E2/M1 pattern but is explicitly schematic and restricted to one proton subshell.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- Signature-partner and three-quasiparticle alternatives are tested through excitation energy, alignment and transition strengths, then rejected by the authors.
- The calculation uses selected moments of inertia and `γ`; agreement is not an independent measurement of a rigid triaxial shape.
- Absolute lifetimes are not measured in this experiment; transition probabilities are relative to `B(E2)_in`.
- Alternate-spin links were too weak/low-energy for meaningful upper limits, leaving incomplete coverage of the predicted zigzag pattern.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | 审核项 | Agent 判断 | Evidence / locator | 审核状态 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OD01-AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The established links, polarization-selected large-|δ| branch, and relative strengths supply the missing experimental chain. | Key Results and Competing Interpretations above | unreviewed |
| OD01-AR-2 | Assumptions and dependencies | The adopted δ branch, common TSD1/TSD2 intrinsic configuration, and schematic PRM mapping are valid over the measured high-spin range. | Method/results/model sections cited above | unreviewed |
| OD01-AR-3 | Transfer conditions | Transfer only to bands with established common configuration and independently constrained link multipolarities; low-spin cases require their own evidence. | Source scope and claim locators above | unreviewed |
| OD01-AR-4 | Failure conditions | A different δ branch, configuration mismatch, or absolute strengths inconsistent with the relative-strength pattern would weaken the assignment. | Competing Interpretations and Limitations above | unreviewed |
| OD01-AR-5 | Reverse/falsification test | Measure absolute lifetimes and re-evaluate several links with independent polarization/mixing-ratio constraints. | Follow-up observables identified by the source/Agent | unreviewed |
| OD01-AR-6 | Research-question decision | Retain as a high-spin benchmark, with explicit limits on transfer to low-spin and different-quasiparticle regimes. | Whole-source assessment | unreviewed |

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Existing Wiki understanding: The pre-2001 Wiki record treated TSD2 as an unconnected candidate rather than an electromagnetically identified wobbling excitation.
- Effect of this source: revises
- Reason: The established links, polarization-selected large-|δ| branch, and relative strengths supply the missing experimental chain.
- Persistence decision: project update / synthesis update
- Review state: page-level `human-reviewed`; Key Results claims remain `needs_review: true` for future claim-specific paper use.

## Human Review Triage

Review disposition: the user completed a rough page-level review on 2026-07-25 and accepted the current evidence-calibrated wording without correction. The P0/P1 items below are retained as future strict paper-use verification prompts, not unresolved ingest blockers.

### P0

- P0: none identified.

### P1

- `OD01-2`/`OD01-3` and Fig. 5/Table I — Evidence: polarization selects the large-|δ| electric branch and relative strengths favor wobbling. Agent inference: this is a strong benchmark but remains branch- and model-conditioned. User check: δ sign/branch, quoted E2 fraction, and the relative-strength comparison. Risk: an incorrect branch or overbroad transfer would inflate later low-spin claims.

### P2/P3

- P2: confirm bibliographic symbol rendering and transition notation. P3: navigation links only.

## Human Review Record
