# High-Spin Level Structure of `104Ag`

## Bibliographic Record

Physical Review C 88, 024306 (2013), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevC.88.024306`. The protected BibTeX key is `wang_2013_Highspinlevel`.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: all nine PDF pages; experiment/ADO calibration; complete Table I and Bands A-F scheme; spin-parity assignments; A/B chiral fingerprints; C single-particle interpretation; D/E electric-quadrupole configurations/mixing; F magnetic-rotation assignment; summary.
- Not covered: raw coincidence matrix, detector efficiencies, the earlier `104Ag` band-identification papers, or the cited axial-rotor/TAC/chiral-model sources in full.
- Coverage caveats: the paper reports no lifetimes or polarization; ratios in Fig.4 are not absolute strengths and their derivation is referred to earlier work; several spins/parities/configurations are tentative or systematics based.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

The experiment maps the coexistence of single-particle excitations, electric-quadrupole and magnetic rotation, and possible nuclear chirality in the particle-hole nucleus `104Ag`. For the chiral question it asks whether linked negative-parity Bands A/B share `πg9/2^-1⊗νh11/2` and exhibit the common energy, staggering and alignment fingerprints used in A≈100 candidates (PDF pp.1,4-6).

## Method and Design Logic

- A higher-statistics fusion-evaporation γ-γ experiment reconstructs Bands A-F from coincidences, intensity balances and energy sums (PDF pp.1-5; Figs.1-3; Table I).
- ADO ratios from asymmetric angle matrices separate stretched quadrupole (`≈1.2`) from pure dipole (`≈0.8`) transitions and support spin changes (PDF pp.1-2).
- Bands A/B are compared through same-spin energy separation, `S(I)`, `B(M1)/B(E2)`, `B(M1)in/B(M1)out` and quasiparticle alignment (PDF pp.5-7; Figs.4-5).
- Bands C-F are assigned by low-lying multiplet logic, Ag-isotope systematics and prior theoretical work, not by new dedicated calculations (PDF pp.6-7; Fig.6).

## Summary

More than 40 new γ rays revise and extend a six-structure A-F scheme. The paper suggests negative-parity A/B as a `πg9/2^-1⊗νh11/2` chiral-doublet candidate: their separation falls below `300 keV` at `I=15`, `S(I)` is smooth/similar, ratio staggering is in phase and alignments are nearly identical. A subsection calls them “true chiral partners,” but the abstract/summary retain “candidate,” and no lifetime, polarization or dedicated `104Ag` chiral calculation is provided. Positive-parity D/E are assigned electric-quadrupole rotational bands with `d5/2/g7/2` configurations and mixing; F retains a prior magnetic-rotation/four-quasiparticle interpretation.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- `97Mo(11B,4n)104Ag` at `50 MeV`, CIAE HI-13 tandem.
- `2.0 mg/cm²`, `94.25%` enriched `97Mo` target on `8.0 mg/cm²` natural Pb backing.
- Thirteen Compton-suppressed HPGe detectors at forward, `90°` and backward angles.
- At least two suppressed detectors within an `80 ns` prompt window; `1.5×10^8` coincidence events.
- Energy/efficiency standards: `60Co`, `133Ba`, `152Eu`; resolution `2.0-2.5 keV` FWHM at `1332.5 keV`.
- ADO definition `R_ADO=Iγ(40° or 140°)/Iγ(90°)` with all-angle gates; typical stretched-E2/pure-dipole values `1.2/≈0.8`.

## Key Results

| ID | Statement | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| W13-1 | The experiment records `1.5×10^8` prompt γ-γ events with 13 suppressed HPGe detectors following `97Mo(11B,4n)` at `50 MeV`. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.1-2 | true |
| W13-2 | Coincidences, intensity balances and energy sums establish a revised six-structure A-F scheme with more than 40 new γ rays. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.2; Figs.1-3; Table I | true |
| W13-3 | ADO ratios use typical values `1.2` for stretched quadrupole and `≈0.8` for pure dipole transitions. | method-result | direct | PDF pp.1-2 | true |
| W13-4 | New Band-B links establish a proposed `(10−)` bandhead at `2212 keV`, `(11−)` at `2711 keV` and a linked extension to `16−`; several assignments remain parenthesized. | experimental-assignment | direct | PDF pp.2-5; Fig.1; Table I | true |
| W13-5 | Band A inherits a `πg9/2^-1⊗νh11/2` assignment from earlier axial-rotor-plus-two-quasiparticle calculations; the same configuration is suggested for B from neighboring-systematics. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.4-5 | true |
| W13-6 | A/B are linked by strong M1 transitions; same-spin separation decreases with spin and is below `300 keV` at `I=15`, but does not reach the degeneracy reported for `104Rh`. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.5; Figs.1,4a | true |
| W13-7 | The remaining separation is interpreted as γ-soft chiral vibration by analogy, without a new shape calculation for `104Ag`. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.5 | true |
| W13-8 | A/B have broadly smooth/similar `S(I)`, in-phase ratio staggering and nearly identical quasiparticle alignments. | derived-observable | direct | PDF pp.5-7; Figs.4-5 | true |
| W13-9 | `B(M1)/B(E2)` and `B(M1)in/B(M1)out` in Fig.4 are ratio fingerprints referenced to earlier methodology; no lifetime-separated absolute strengths or mixing ratios are reported here. | evidence-boundary | direct | PDF pp.5-6; Fig.4 | true |
| W13-10 | The discussion calls A/B “true chiral partners,” while the abstract and summary call them candidate chiral doublet bands. | source-language-conflict | direct | PDF pp.1,6,8 | true |
| W13-11 | No dedicated `104Ag` TAC/PRM calculation or measured angular-momentum geometry is presented for A/B. | model-boundary | direct | Full paper | true |
| W13-12 | Based on candidate systematics, the authors propose `N=57` as the low-neutron-number border for A≈100 chiral nuclei but state more data are required. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.6 | true |
| W13-13 | Positive-parity D/E are assigned `πg9/2^-1⊗νd5/2` and `πg9/2^-1⊗νg7/2`; staggering/strong links are interpreted as configuration mixing by Ag-isotope analogy. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.2,7; Fig.6 | true |
| W13-14 | Band-like C is associated with the `2+` isomer and a low-lying proton-neutron multiplet, but the configuration discussion remains tentative. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.2,6-7 | true |
| W13-15 | Band F retains an earlier magnetic-rotation assignment and is proposed as a four-quasiparticle `πg9/2^-1⊗ν(g7/2/d5/2)(h11/2)^2` structure by comparison with `106,108Ag`. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.7 | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

| Structure | Parity / role | Assignment and boundary |
|---|---|---|
| A/B | negative, linked candidate doublet | common `πg9/2^-1⊗νh11/2` suggested; candidate overall despite local “true” wording |
| C | positive band-like multiplet | connected to `2+` isomer; detailed particle/hole content tentative |
| D/E | positive electric-quadrupole rotational bands | `d5/2`/`g7/2` configurations with mixing inferred from systematics |
| F | positive magnetic-rotational band | earlier TAC-supported assignment; four-quasiparticle identity proposed by analogy |

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- A/B fingerprints are not independent proof: energy separation persists, ratios are nonabsolute and alignment similarity can follow a common configuration without handedness.
- The paper has an internal wording gradient from “true partners” to “candidate”; the conservative stable status is candidate.
- γ softness/chiral vibration is imported from systematics, not established by a `104Ag` potential-energy or dynamical calculation.
- D/E and F configurations depend heavily on neighboring Ag nuclei and prior calculations; several spins are tentative.
- No lifetimes, mixing ratios, linear polarization, g factors or dedicated quantum chiral calculation are supplied.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | Audit item | Agent judgment | Evidence / locator | review_status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The durable advance is the revised A-F scheme and a strongly fingerprinted A/B candidate, not confirmed chirality. | W13-2, W13-4 to W13-11 | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | Assumptions | Common configuration, γ softness and ratio staggering depend on earlier/systematic inputs; absolute electromagnetic equality is not measured. | W13-5, W13-7, W13-9 | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Failure condition | Lifetime/mixing-ratio data or a dedicated model favoring ordinary configuration mixing/signature partners could overturn the chiral interpretation while retaining A/B. | Full paper | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Reverse test | Measure absolute in-/out-of-band matrix elements and compare chiral PRM/TAC dynamics against γ-soft/configuration-mixing alternatives on the same bands. | W13-9 to W13-11 | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Transfer condition | The proposed `N=57` boundary is a provisional census statement, not an exclusion theorem for lower-N nuclei. | W13-12 | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research decision | Persist A/B as a candidate with a source-language conflict; persist D/E and F as separate electric and magnetic rotation references. | Full paper | unreviewed |

### Companion Evidence Audit

- A-F scheme, links and ADO values: `observed/assigned`.
- A/B common configuration and chiral vibration: `systematics/model interpretation`.
- A/B absolute matrix-element equality: `not measured`.
- D/E mixing and F four-quasiparticle identity: `analogy/prior-model interpretation`.
- `N=57` lower border: `provisional author systematics`.

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Effect: `supports` a `104Ag` candidate and collective-mode coexistence map, while `limits` confirmation and lower-border wording.
- Persistence: create source, nucleus, experiment, A/B candidate, D/E electric-rotation and F magnetic-rotation pages; update the chirality project.
- Review state: all `W13-*` and AR claims remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence gate.

## Human Review Triage

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **W13-10 — source-language conflict.** Decide whether any downstream prose may quote the local “true chiral partners” phrase; default status remains candidate.
- **W13-5/7/11 — configuration/shape/model scope.** Keep inherited configuration and γ-soft analogy separate from new experimental facts.
- **W13-8/9 — ratio and alignment semantics.** Do not rewrite fingerprints as absolute partner-band matrix-element equality.
- **W13-12 — low-N border.** Preserve “candidate census + more data required,” not a physical exclusion boundary.

### P2/P3

- P2: verify parenthesized spin/parity labels before precision reuse.
- P3: audit band C particle/hole notation directly against the printed formulas if a separate C page is later needed.
