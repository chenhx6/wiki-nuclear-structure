# Evidence for wobbling excitation in `161Lu`

## Bibliographic Record

EPJ A 24, 167-172 (2005), DOI `10.1140/epja/i2005-10005-7`; PDF/BibTeX identity checked.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`
- Covered scope: full article, setup, TSD1 extension, TSD2 discovery, rotational systematics and limitations.
- Not covered: unpublished/forthcoming detailed level data and independent model calculations.
- Coverage caveats: electromagnetic properties of TSD2→TSD1 links were not determined; energies/spins are tentative.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

- Author-explicit motivation: extend Lu-isotope wobbling systematics to lighter `161Lu` and test whether a newly found TSD2 sequence behaves like the n_w=1 partners in heavier Lu isotopes (PDF pp.167-168).

## Method and Design Logic

- Build and extend the TSD level scheme from high-fold EUROBALL coincidences, compare excitation, alignment and moments of inertia with `163,165,167Lu`, and state explicitly which electromagnetic measurements remain unavailable (PDF pp.168-172, Figs.1-8).

## Key Evidence and Reasoning Chain

- TSD2 decay links and similar rotational systematics → candidate common TSD family; lack of δ/polarization/lifetimes → no direct E2-strength test; isotope analogy → authors say “strongly suggest,” not confirm, wobbling (PDF pp.170-172).

## Summary

This is a deliberately weaker case: the authors say Lu-isotope systematics “strongly suggest” `n_w=0,1`, while explicitly acknowledging that the final electromagnetic proof is missing.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

`139La(28Si,6n)161Lu` at 175 MeV, Vivitron/IReS Strasbourg, EUROBALL; `2.8×10^9` presorted events in cubes/hypercube.

## Key Results

| ID | 陈述 | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BR05-1 | TSD1 was extended by six transitions and a weaker TSD2 sequence decaying to TSD1 was discovered. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.168-170, Figs.1-3 | true |
| BR05-2 | TSD1/TSD2 populations are about `1.4%/0.6%` of the `161Lu` channel. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.170 | true |
| BR05-3 | TSD bands show rotational/alignment systematics similar to heavier odd-A Lu isotopes; TSD2 lies about 650 keV above TSD1 in the tentative scheme. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.170-171, Figs.5-8 | true |
| BR05-4 | Absolute excitation energies and spins are not firmly established. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.171 | true |
| BR05-5 | Electromagnetic properties of the `ΔI=1` links could not be determined and are explicitly identified as the missing final proof. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.171 | true |
| BR05-6 | Authors conclude that systematics strongly suggest TSD1/TSD2 as `n_w=0/1` wobbling excitations. | author-interpretation | contextual | PDF pp.171-172, Summary | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

TSD1 is extended and a weak TSD2 sequence is connected to it; absolute excitation energies/spins remain tentative and TSD2 lies roughly 650 keV above TSD1 in the proposed scheme.

## Authors' Interpretation

The authors interpret the pair as n_w=0/1 primarily from Lu-isotope systematics and explicitly identify electromagnetic characterization as the missing final proof.

## Model Results

No independent transition-strength PRM test is presented for the assignment. Cranked-systematics discussion concerns shapes, alignments and crossings rather than a direct wobbling observable.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

Shape differences and neutron crossings are discussed; no measured mixing ratio, polarization or relative E2 strength closes the assignment.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | 审核项 | Agent 判断 | Evidence / locator | 审核状态 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BR05-AR-1 | Core reconstruction | This source establishes a linked systematic candidate, not an electromagnetic wobbling identification. | Key Results and Competing Interpretations above | unreviewed |
| BR05-AR-2 | Assumptions and dependencies | The adopted band identities, mixing-ratio branches, configuration assignments, and model inputs are valid within the stated measured range. | Method/results/model sections cited above | unreviewed |
| BR05-AR-3 | Transfer conditions | Transfer only the measured observables and their explicit conditions; do not transfer the author interpretation without equivalent link and configuration evidence. | Source scope and claim locators above | unreviewed |
| BR05-AR-4 | Failure conditions | Alternative branch, band identity, configuration, or model dependence can weaken the structural label even when the measured transitions remain valid. | Competing Interpretations and Limitations above | unreviewed |
| BR05-AR-5 | Reverse/falsification test | Obtain independent lifetimes/multipolarities or common-input competing-model tests targeted to the stated evidence gap. | Follow-up observables identified by the source/Agent | unreviewed |
| BR05-AR-6 | Research-question decision | Retain the source in the project/synthesis evidence map with the source-local review boundary explicit. | Whole-source assessment | unreviewed |

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Existing Wiki understanding: The Wiki already contained the broader wobbling topic and related candidate map, but not this source in a complete source-local evidence and review structure.
- Effect of this source: supports
- Reason: This source establishes a linked systematic candidate, not an electromagnetic wobbling identification.
- Persistence decision: project update / synthesis update
- Review state: page-level `human-reviewed`; Key Results claims remain `needs_review: true` for future claim-specific paper use.

## Human Review Triage

Review disposition: the user completed a rough page-level review on 2026-07-25 and accepted the current evidence-calibrated wording without correction. The P0/P1 items below are retained as future strict paper-use verification prompts, not unresolved ingest blockers.

### P0

- `BR05-4`/`BR05-5`/`BR05-6`, PDF pp.170-172 — Evidence: spins/energies are tentative and no mixing ratio, polarization, lifetime or relative E2 strength is measured. Agent inference: this is a systematics-only candidate. User check: whether any cited external measurement closes the gap. Risk: presenting it as observed/confirmed would convert analogy into direct evidence.

### P1

- P1: check the Lu-isotope alignment/MoI homology and neutron-crossing caveats in Figs.5-8.

### P2/P3

- P2: population and tentative-energy transcription. P3: navigation.

## Human Review Record

- 2026-07-25: the user completed a rough review of this source page and accepted its current claims, attribution boundaries, locators and stated limitations without requesting corrections.

## Review Status

Page-level review is complete for this ingest round. Claim-level `needs_review` and Analytical Reconstruction review markers remain unchanged because this was a rough review rather than exhaustive claim-by-claim paper certification.

## Extracted Pages

- Nuclei: [[161lu]]
- Concepts: [[wobbling-motion]]

## Non-source Notes and Follow-up

Keep wording at “evidence/strongly suggests,” never “observed/confirmed.”
