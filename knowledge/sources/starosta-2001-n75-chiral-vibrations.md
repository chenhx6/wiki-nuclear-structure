# Chiral Doublet Structures in Odd-Odd `N=75` Isotones: Chiral Vibrations

## Bibliographic Record

Physical Review Letters 86, 971-974 (2001), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.971`. The four-page article and protected BibTeX export uniquely match `starosta_2001_ChiralDoublet`.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: complete article, Fig. 1 chirality/octupole analogy, Fig. 2 four-isotone partial level schemes, Fig. 3 doublet-energy systematics, Table I five-isotone 3D TAC results, experimental descriptions, alternative explanations and conclusions.
- Not covered: raw coincidence data, the earlier level-scheme papers for each yrast band, event-level timing/angle calibration, or the preliminary `138Eu` proceedings source.
- Coverage caveats: the printed `136Pm` reaction `116Sn(24Mg,4n)136Pm` violates charge conservation; the same beam-target system is given as `p3n` by Hecht 2001. Detector-count descriptions also differ, so exact data-set identity/overlap remains unresolved rather than silently normalized.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

- The authors ask whether similar low-lying same-parity doublet bands in the odd-odd `N=75` isotones form a finite island of chiral rotation and whether their nonzero band separation represents a collective chiral-vibrational precursor to nearly degenerate chiral partners (PDF pp. 1-2 / journal pp. 971-972).
- The proposed geometry couples proton `h11/2` along the short axis, neutron `h11/2` along the long axis and core rotation along the intermediate axis; laboratory symmetry restoration should produce doublet `ΔI=1` bands, while a soft/low-barrier system can oscillate or tunnel between handed orientations (PDF pp. 1, 3 / journal pp. 971, 973; Fig. 1).

## Method and Design Logic

- Coincidence experiments extend known `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` yrast bands and identify new sidebands in `130Cs`, `132La` and `136Pm`; `134Pr` is imported from Petrache et al. Ref. 3 for a four-isotone comparison (PDF p. 2 / journal p. 972; Fig. 2).
- Timing-resolved γ-ray angular correlations identify links between each new sideband and yrast band as `ΔI=1` mixed `M1/E2`, establishing positive parity and relative-spin sequences. Cross-isotone energy-spacing patterns are then used to choose a common `I=9ℏ` bandhead (PDF pp. 2-3 / journal pp. 972-973).
- Energy displacement, interleaving and selection-rule arguments motivate a common configuration and distinguish near-degenerate `134Pr` from the more separated `130Cs/132La/136Pm` pairs. A 3D TAC calculation across `Z=55–63` supplies deformation, tilt angles, barrier heights and transition strengths, but the chiral vibration itself is proposed analytically rather than calculated as a collective quantum spectrum (PDF pp. 3-4 / journal pp. 973-974; Fig. 3; Table I).

## Key Evidence and Reasoning Chain

- New sidebands + mixed `M1/E2` links + similar alternating `ΔI=1` spacings → same-parity doublet structures with a shared relative-spin pattern (Fig. 2; PDF pp. 2-3).
- Mixed links plus an orbital-selection-rule argument → author inference that the sidebands share the yrast `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` configuration (PDF p. 3).
- `134Pr` near-degeneracy versus roughly constant `0.25/0.37/0.29 MeV` displacement in `130Cs/132La/136Pm` → central chiral-rotation island surrounded by soft chiral-vibrational structures (PDF pp. 3-4; Fig. 3).
- Aplanar 3D TAC solutions and barrier/deformation systematics across `Z=55–63` → model support for a bounded island, strongest near `Z=59–61`; the experimental nondegenerate pairs are interpreted as vibrations/tunnelling over a shallow saddle (PDF pp. 3-4; Table I).

## Summary

The paper establishes a four-isotone experimental doublet-band systematics and embeds it in a five-isotone TAC calculation. It promotes `134Pr` as the near-degenerate center of a chiral-rotation island and interprets the surrounding nondegenerate partners as soft chiral vibrations. This is a landmark cross-isotone interpretation, but not an independent confirmation of all individual pairs: `134Pr` is reused from Petrache 1996, the `136Pm` dataset/authors overlap Hecht 2001, common configuration is inferred, and no quantum chiral-vibration calculation produces the measured displacements.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- `130Cs`: `124Sn(10B,4n)130Cs` at `47 MeV`, Stony Brook LINAC; 2-3 mg/cm² `124Sn` target backed with Pb; suppressed Ge detectors at `±30°`, `±90°`, `±150°` plus multiplicity filter (PDF p. 2 / journal p. 972).
- `132La`: `123Sb(13C,4n)132La` at `64 MeV`, same facility/geometry class; 2-3 mg/cm² `123Sb` target backed with Pb (PDF p. 2 / journal p. 972).
- `136Pm`: source text reports `116Sn(24Mg,4n)136Pm` at `130 MeV`, Yale Tandem/YRAST Ball with 28 suppressed Ge including five segmented clovers and two stacked `≈800 μg/cm²` targets (PDF p. 2 / journal p. 972). The printed `4n` channel is charge-inconsistent and conflicts with Hecht 2001 `p3n`.
- 3D TAC: hybrid spherical Woods-Saxon plus deformed modified-harmonic-oscillator potential; pairing gaps fixed to 80% of empirical even-odd mass differences; full self-consistency in tilt/deformation at `ℏω=0.35 MeV`, with fixed `ε,γ` and refitted tilt angles at other frequencies (PDF p. 3 / journal p. 973).

|---|---|---|---|
| `130Cs` | new sideband linked to known yrast band | roughly constant `≈0.25 MeV` displacement | soft chiral-vibrational doublet candidate |
| `132La` | new sideband linked to known yrast band | roughly constant `≈0.37 MeV` displacement | soft chiral-vibrational doublet candidate |

| `138Eu` | included only in the five-isotone TAC table and as preliminary data in Ref. 11 | no current-work experimental scheme | shallower/narrower modeled chiral solution; later direct experiment must be checked separately |

## Authors' Interpretation

The authors treat the recurring doublets as a collective `N=75` phenomenon, not ordinary signature partners. `134Pr` is the most stable/near-degenerate chiral case; the other observed pairs are soft chiral vibrations in which the core angular momentum oscillates or tunnels between left- and right-handed orientations. The conclusion explicitly retains the conditional “if the chiral doublet interpretation is correct” for the stable-triaxiality implication.

## Model Results

- At the quoted frequencies, Table I gives `γ=39°,32°,27°,27°,20°` for `Z=55–63`, and barriers `E_b=3,12,30,30,10 keV`.
- The calculation predicts both interband (`+→+`) and intraband (`+→−`) transition strengths for aplanar solutions; a planar solution would yield one band. The table is a TAC output, not a direct calculation of the measured doublet excitation energy.
- Self-consistency is complete at one frequency; deformation is then frozen while tilt angles are recalculated over `0.20–0.45 MeV`. This weak-frequency-dependence approximation is part of the model boundary.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- Quasiparticle and γ-vibrational alternatives are rejected mainly by characteristic energy scales; no unified quantum calculation compares their spectra and transition matrix elements with the chiral-vibration proposal.
- The same-configuration claim depends on a qualitative selection-rule argument and observed mixed links, not absolute matrix elements or a configuration-specific measurement.
- Relative spins and a common `I=9` bandhead are systematics-driven; absolute bandhead spins are not directly fixed by the experiment.
- The article does not calculate a collective chiral-vibrational wave function, excitation energy or tunnelling splitting. TAC supplies static/aplanar mean-field minima and barriers.
- Evidence independence is limited: `134Pr` is imported from earlier work; Starosta and Hecht share many authors and related `136Pm` data/systematics; Hecht 2001 uses this paper for its bandhead spins.
- The printed `136Pm` reaction and detector description conflict with Hecht 2001; exact experiment overlap remains unresolved.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | 审核项 | Agent 判断 | Evidence / locator | 审核状态 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | Starosta 2001 converts several nucleus-specific partner-band observations into an evolutionary hypothesis: central near-degenerate chiral rotation (`134Pr`) plus soft chiral vibrations (`130Cs/132La/136Pm`). This is cross-source/systematics interpretation, not four independent discoveries. | ST01-1, ST01-6 to ST01-12; Figs. 2-3 | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | Assumptions and dependencies | Common bandhead spin, common configuration, deformation/barrier systematics and the mapping from band displacement to vibrational energy are all necessary; only relative spins and decay links are direct experiment. | ST01-4 to ST01-10 | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Transfer conditions | The pattern can motivate comparisons across isotones only when band identities, parity, links and configurations are checked independently. Shared authors/data and imported level schemes must not be counted as independent replication. | Fig. 2 provenance; HE01 overlap | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Failure conditions | If absolute electromagnetic observables or a competing quantum model reproduce the same pairs without left/right dynamics, energy-displacement systematics alone cannot identify chiral vibration. | ST01-7 to ST01-10 and missing quantum calculation | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Reverse/falsification test | Recalculate each pair in a quantum particle-rotor/collective Hamiltonian including γ softness and tunnelling, compare absolute inter/intraband strengths and staggering, and test whether the inferred vibrational energy tracks a calculated barrier/mass rather than merely the band displacement. | Table I plus experimental gaps | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research-question decision | Persist a project-level N=75 evolution map and a metadata-conflict question. Do not create a standalone chiral-vibration synthesis until later lifetime/model papers show whether the 2001 island picture survives. | Full article and HE01 comparison | unreviewed |

### Companion Evidence Audit

- Sideband-to-yrast mixed links in `130Cs/132La/136Pm`: `observed` in the reported coincidence/angle analysis and drawn in Fig. 2.
- Absolute/common bandhead spin `I=9`: `expected-but-not-established`; selected by systematics and prior Ref. 8.
- Same `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` configuration: `expected-but-not-established`; inferred from link strength/selection rules.
- Collective chiral vibration: `expected-but-not-established`; no vibrational eigenstate calculation is supplied.
- Exact `136Pm` channel and Starosta/Hecht event-set overlap: `blocked-needs-experiment-log/raw-metadata`.

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Existing Wiki understanding: chirality fingerprints are model dependent, and energy nondegeneracy can represent finite tunnelling/chiral vibration rather than refuting the mechanism outright.
- Effect of this source: `supports`, `revises` and `limits`.
- Reason: it establishes the historical N=75 island/vibration narrative and strengthens the 134Pr reinterpretation, while revealing non-independent provenance, a reaction-metadata conflict and the absence of a quantum vibrational calculation.
- Persistence decision: create source, `130Cs/132La` nucleus/experiment/pair pages and a `134Pr` stable pair mapping; update `134Pr/136Pm`, the existing Hecht pair/experiment and the chirality project. Record the N=75 thematic REFLECT in the project; defer overview/QMD until a later batch checkpoint.
- Review state: all ST01 claims and analytical reconstruction remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence pool.

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **ST01-2/ST01-3 — `136Pm` reaction metadata conflict.** Grounded evidence: PDF p. 972 prints `116Sn(24Mg,4n)136Pm`, which violates charge conservation; Hecht 2001 prints `p3n` for a related Yale/YRAST experiment. Agent inference: likely source typo, but exact dataset identity and correction cannot be assumed. User check: verify against an erratum, original experiment record or cited proceedings. Risk: propagating an impossible channel or silently rewriting source evidence.
- **ST01-5/ST01-7 and AR-2 — spin/configuration inference.** Grounded evidence: relative spins come from angular correlations; common `I=9` and `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` follow systematics/selection-rule reasoning. Agent inference: links strongly constrain but do not directly measure configuration. User check: assess whether project wording retains this hierarchy. Risk: circular systematics and overconfident common-basis claims.
- **ST01-8 to ST01-12 and AR-1/AR-4 — chiral-vibration/island model boundary.** Grounded evidence: band displacements, TAC barriers and regional energy scales support the narrative, but no collective quantum vibration calculation is performed and the final stable-triaxial claim is conditional. User check: preserve “author interpretation/candidate” language and do not equate displacement with a measured vibrational eigenenergy. Risk: turning an influential analogy into direct dynamics evidence.
- **Evidence independence — Starosta/Hecht overlap.** Grounded evidence: shared authors, related `136Pm` YRAST data and Hecht's explicit use of Ref. 6 spin systematics. Agent inference: these are complementary papers in one evidence lineage, not independent replication. User check: confirm the project evidence map marks the dependency. Risk: inflated confidence from double-counting.

### P2/P3

- P2: verify the Fig. 2 band mapping, energy-displacement transcription and Table I values.
- P3: review source aliases, two Stony Brook experiment pages, pair navigation and batch-reflect wording.
