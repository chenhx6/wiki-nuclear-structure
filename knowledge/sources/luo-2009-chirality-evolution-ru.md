# Evolution of Chirality from γ-Soft `108Ru` to Triaxial `110,112Ru`

## Bibliographic Record

Physics Letters B 670, 307-312 (2009), DOI `10.1016/j.physletb.2008.10.067`. The protected BibTeX key is `luo_2009_Evolutionchirality`.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: all six PDF pages; new level schemes; coincidence/angular-correlation evidence; γ-soft/triaxial systematics; energy, `S(I)` and branching-ratio fingerprints; TAC/RPA setup and outputs; alternative configuration test; RPA-breakdown and large-amplitude boundary.
- Not covered: raw coincidence cubes, the earlier positive-parity IBM analysis, original `108,110,112Ru` scheme papers, or the full TAC+RPA derivation cited as Ref.26.
- Coverage caveats: `B(E2)/B(M1)` values are branching-derived with pure-M1 assumptions, not lifetime-separated absolute strengths; bandhead lifetime information is only reported as `<1 ns`; the `110,112Ru` structural/chiral interpretation is model dependent.

## Extracted Pages

- PDF pp.1-2 / journal pp.307-308: motivation, chirality fingerprints, full new level schemes and γ-soft/triaxial background.
- PDF p.3 / journal p.309: dataset, angular correlations, negative-parity assignments, `108Ru` exclusion from further interpretation, energy and `S(I)` comparisons.
- PDF p.4 / journal p.310: branching-derived ratios, `134Pr` comparison, zero-/one-phonon proposal and TAC/RPA setup.
- PDF p.5 / journal p.311: microscopic configuration, TAC/RPA results, alternative configuration, `112Ru` crossing/RPA breakdown and conclusion.
- PDF p.6 / journal p.312: references.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

The source asks whether negative-parity `ΔI=1` doublet structures in even-even Ru nuclei can realize chiral motion without the classic odd-odd high-j particle–hole geometry, and whether the evolution from γ-soft `108Ru` to more rigidly triaxial `110,112Ru` changes that motion (PDF pp.1-2).

## Method and Design Logic

- High-statistics prompt γ coincidences from `252Cf` spontaneous fission establish weak bands and links in three Ru isotopes (PDF pp.2-3; Figs.1-2).
- Angle-sorted γ-γ correlations constrain selected spins and dipole transition character. Previously studied positive-parity γ-band staggering/IBM comparisons supply γ-soft versus triaxial context (PDF p.3).
- Same-spin separations, `S(I)` and branching-derived `B(E2)/B(M1)` ratios test doublet similarity. The ratios assume `ΔI=1` transitions are M1 (PDF pp.3-4; Figs.3-4; Table 1).
- Self-consistent TAC plus RPA tests a two-quasineutron zero-/one-phonon interpretation; an alternative neutron configuration and triaxial-rotor calculation probe configuration uniqueness (PDF pp.4-5; Fig.5).

## Summary

New negative-parity `ΔI=1` doublet structures are identified in `108,110,112Ru`. The γ-soft `108Ru` structures develop mismatched signature behavior and are not pursued as chiral partners. In `110,112Ru`, the composite sequences Bands 4-5 and Bands 6-7 approach closely, have comparable constant `S(I)` and similar branching-derived ratios. The authors interpret them as zero- and one-phonon soft chiral-vibrational bands. Their TAC solution, however, remains planar (`φ=0°`) and explicitly does not develop static chirality; RPA describes only small-amplitude motion. In the `112Ru` crossing region RPA breaks down, so direct quantitative comparison is called inappropriate and a large-amplitude treatment is required.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- `62 μCi` `252Cf` spontaneous-fission source in Gammasphere.
- `5.7×10^11` triple-and-higher-fold coincidences; data later sorted by angle for γ-γ angular correlations.
- Example `110Ru` double gate: `952.5-515.5 keV`; selected cascade coefficients are compared with pure-dipole/pure-quadrupole expectations.
- TAC Hamiltonian: spherical Woods-Saxon plus quadrupole-quadrupole interaction, pairing and cranking in three major oscillator shells; `κ0=0.0605 MeV`, `B=-0.5`, `Δp=1.27 MeV`, `Δn=0.60 MeV`.
- Interpreted configuration: neutron excitation from the highest `h11/2` level to mixed low-lying `d5/2-g7/2` levels.

## Key Results

| ID | Statement | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LU09-1 | New negative-parity `ΔI=1` doublet structures are identified in `108,110,112Ru` from high-fold fission coincidences. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.2-3; Figs.1-2 | true |
| LU09-2 | The dataset contains `5.7×10^11` triple-and-higher-fold coincidences from a `62 μCi 252Cf` source in Gammasphere. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.3 | true |
| LU09-3 | Angle-sorted correlations support selected spins and dipole depopulating transitions; all reported bandheads have lifetimes below `1 ns`, excluding a high-K interpretation in the authors' view. | experimental-assignment | direct | PDF p.3 | true |
| LU09-4 | Earlier IBM/γ-band comparisons are used to classify `108Ru` as γ soft and `110,112Ru` as more rigidly triaxial; this is model/systematics context rather than a direct shape measurement here. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.2-3 | true |
| LU09-5 | In `108Ru`, composite sequences 4-5 and 6-7 show different signature-staggering behavior; different configurations are possible, while the authors prefer γ softness disturbing a chiral doublet and do not discuss them further. | author-interpretation | direct | PDF p.3 | true |
| LU09-6 | Same-spin separations in `110,112Ru` are smaller than those plotted for `104,106Rh`, yet remain finite and are interpreted dynamically rather than as static degeneracy. | derived-observable | direct | PDF pp.3-4; Fig.3 | true |
| LU09-7 | `S(I)` for the two `110,112Ru` composite sequences is approximately equal and constant with spin over the plotted range. | derived-observable | direct | PDF pp.3-4; Fig.4 | true |
| LU09-8 | Table-1 `B(E2)/B(M1)` ratios are obtained mainly from double-gated branching intensities and assume the `ΔI=1` transitions are pure M1. | model-boundary | direct | PDF p.4; Table 1 | true |
| LU09-9 | The two sequences in each of `110,112Ru` have ratios in reasonable agreement; the authors use this to argue for similar structure and against an accidentally degenerate alternative neutron configuration. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.4; Table 1 | true |
| LU09-10 | Bands 4-5 are assigned as the zero-phonon state and Bands 6-7 as the one-phonon soft chiral vibration. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.4-5; Fig.5 | true |
| LU09-11 | TAC gives `γ≈22°`, similar moments of inertia/energies and in-band ratios up to `ℏω≈0.3 MeV`; `θ` changes toward `60°` but `φ=0°`, so the configuration does not develop static chirality. | model-result | direct | PDF p.5; Fig.5 | true |
| LU09-12 | Around `ℏω≈0.3 MeV`, TAC rapidly changes toward `γ≈40°`; no experimental counterpart to that calculated structural change is identified. | model-boundary | direct | PDF p.5 | true |
| LU09-13 | A `≈300 keV` low-lying RPA phonon in `110Ru`, about `1ℏ` less aligned than the zero-phonon state, reproduces the separation and has collective orientation-coordinate content with weak deformation oscillations. | model-result | direct | PDF p.5; Fig.5 | true |
| LU09-14 | Calculated interband M1/E2 transitions are very weak and consistent with experimental upper limits; an alternative neutron configuration has similar energy/inertia but very different ratios. | model-result | indirect | PDF p.5; Fig.5 | true |
| LU09-15 | The `112Ru` crossing is interpreted as chiral instability where RPA breaks down; the authors state that direct TAC+RPA comparison is inappropriate and a large-amplitude theory is required. | model-boundary | direct | PDF p.5 | true |
| LU09-16 | The conclusion is soft chiral vibration or more complicated slow left/right orientation motion, not established static chirality. | author-interpretation | direct | PDF p.5, Conclusion | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

| Nucleus | Experimental structure | Interpretation boundary |
|---|---|---|
| `108Ru` | negative-parity composite sequences 4-5 and 6-7 with unlike signature behavior | γ softness preferred over different configurations, but source stops the chiral analysis |
| `110Ru` | close Bands 4-5 / 6-7, similar ratios and `S(I)` | zero-/one-phonon soft chiral vibration supported by TAC+RPA, not static chirality |
| `112Ru` | close/crossing Bands 4-5 / 6-7, similar ratios and `S(I)` | chiral-instability interpretation enters RPA-breakdown region; large-amplitude model missing |

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- γ-soft/triaxial classifications rely on earlier IBM/γ-band comparisons; no direct shape observable is measured here.
- Pure-M1 and intensity-branching assumptions prevent Table 1 from being an absolute matrix-element equality test.
- Different two-quasineutron configurations are tested in models, but the preferred common configuration remains an interpretation.
- The even-even orientation softness cannot be reduced to a simple high-j particle–hole geometry; the authors invoke interplay of all open-shell neutrons.
- TAC is planar and RPA small-amplitude. `112Ru` crosses into a regime where RPA fails, so the strongest dynamical claim has an explicit theory gap.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | Audit item | Agent judgment | Evidence / locator | review_status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The source establishes even-even negative-parity doublet structures; chiral vibration is an experiment-model interpretation, not a directly observed phonon label. | LU09-1, LU09-7 to LU09-16 | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | Assumptions | Shape classification, pure-M1 ratios, configuration choice and harmonic RPA are all required to reach the zero-/one-phonon assignment. | LU09-4, LU09-8 to LU09-15 | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Failure condition | Measured mixing ratios/absolute strengths inconsistent across the pair, or a large-amplitude calculation favoring ordinary configuration mixing, would overturn the chiral-vibration interpretation without erasing the bands. | Full paper | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Reverse test | Obtain lifetimes and mixing ratios for both sequences and compare large-amplitude orientation dynamics against explicit configuration mixing in the crossing region. | LU09-8, LU09-15 | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Transfer condition | `φ=0°` means the TAC reference is planar; it can anchor a vibrational instability but cannot be cited as static chiral geometry. | LU09-11 | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research decision | Persist `110,112Ru` as soft chiral-vibration candidates, and `108Ru` as a γ-soft doublet control with unresolved structure identity. | Full paper | unreviewed |

### Companion Evidence Audit

- Level sequences, links and selected correlation assignments: `observed`.
- γ softness/triaxial rigidity: `external-model/systematics interpretation`.
- Similar Table-1 ratios: `branching-derived under pure-M1 assumption`.
- Zero-/one-phonon identity: `TAC+RPA interpretation`.
- Static chirality: `not obtained`; planar TAC.
- `112Ru` large-amplitude chiral dynamics: `required but not calculated`.

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Effect: `supports` even-even soft chiral-vibration candidates, `limits` static-chirality wording, and adds a theory-breakdown boundary.
- Persistence: create source, fission experiment, three nuclei and three structure pages; extend [[chiral-vibration]] and the corpus project.
- Review state: all `LU09-*` and AR claims remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence gate.

## Human Review Triage

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **LU09-4/5 — γ-soft evolution.** Keep prior IBM/model context separate from present experimental facts and preserve the unresolved different-configuration alternative in `108Ru`.
- **LU09-8/9 — ratio semantics.** Confirm the pure-M1 and branching-derived nature before using “similar electromagnetic properties.”
- **LU09-10/11/16 — vibration versus static chirality.** Preserve planar `φ=0°` TAC and candidate/soft-motion wording.
- **LU09-15 — `112Ru` breakdown.** Do not plot or quote the harmonic RPA as a valid quantitative crossing description.

### P2/P3

- P2: verify every bandhead spin/parity against Fig.1 before precision reuse.
- P3: review composite `4-5` / `6-7` naming against earlier Ru band-label sources.
