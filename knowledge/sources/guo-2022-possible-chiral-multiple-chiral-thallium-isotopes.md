# Possible Existence of Chiral and Multiple Chiral Nuclei in Thallium Isotopes

## Bibliographic Record

Chinese Physics C 46, 074107 (2022), DOI `10.1088/1674-1137/ac6248`. The protected BibTeX key is `guo_2022_Possibleexistence`.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: all ten PDF pages; adiabatic and configuration-fixed constrained triaxial RMF setup; potential-energy curves; Tables 1-2; candidate-minimum selection; odd-odd and odd-mass configuration systematics; imported experimental energy and `B(M1)/B(E2)` comparisons; limitations and null cases.
- Not covered: original experimental papers behind Fig. 4, numerical wavefunctions, convergence files, pairing-inclusive calculations, rotational TAC/PRM spectra, or electromagnetic calculations for the predicted candidates.
- Coverage caveat: this is a theory prediction paper. It finds static constrained minima, not rotational partner bands or left/right angular-momentum geometry.

## Extracted Pages

- PDF pp.1-2: motivation, earlier Tl candidates, constrained RMF formalism, PK1 basis and no-pairing setup.
- PDF pp.3-4: odd-odd/odd-mass potential-energy curves, favorable `15°≤γ≤45°` display window, `199,200Tl` null controls, occupation notation and single-particle examples.
- PDF pp.5-6: complete candidate-minimum Tables 1-2.
- PDF pp.7-9: odd-odd and odd-mass candidate interpretation, secondary experimental systematics, prediction counts, limitations and summary.
- PDF pp.9-10: references.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

The paper asks whether constrained triaxial relativistic mean-field calculations locate multiple low-lying minima in `192-200Tl` with both favorable triaxial deformation and suitable high-`j` particle-hole occupations, and therefore which isotopes/configurations merit experimental searches for chirality and MχD (PDF pp.1-3).

## Method and Design Logic

- Solve adiabatic and configuration-fixed constrained triaxial RMF equations with PK1. Dirac spinors use 12 major harmonic-oscillator shells and meson fields 20 shells (PDF p.2).
- Constrain `β=0-0.5`, while plotting only `β<0.3` because no suitable chiral configurations occur above it. At each fixed `β`, minimize in `γ` (PDF pp.2-3).
- Use the adiabatic curves to locate low-energy shapes, then trace fixed occupations to obtain configuration-specific minima. The figures shade `15°≤γ≤45°` as favorable for chirality and mark suitable minima with blue asterisks (PDF pp.2-3; Figs.1-2).
- Classify unpaired high-`j` occupations explicitly; low-`j` neutron `3p3/2`, `3p1/2` and `2f5/2` occupations are grouped as `(fp)` because the calculation cannot distinguish them reliably (PDF p.4).
- Compare selected previously measured energies and `B(M1)/B(E2)` values only as secondary systematics; the calculation itself does not produce the partner bands (PDF pp.7-9; Fig.4).

## Summary

The constrained PK1 calculation finds multiple candidate triaxial minima in `192-198Tl` and no suitable minimum in `199,200Tl`. For odd-odd `192,194,196,198Tl`, the recurring unpaired configuration is `πh9/2⊗νi13/2^-1`; `194Tl` also has a higher four-quasiparticle `πh9/2⊗ν(i13/2)^-3` candidate. For odd-mass `193,195,197Tl`, candidates combine a `πh9/2` particle with either two `i13/2` neutron holes or one low-`j` `(fp)` neutron plus one `i13/2` hole; `197Tl` additionally has a `πi13/2⊗ν(fp)^1i13/2^-1` candidate. The authors infer possible MχD throughout `192-198Tl`, but this is a necessary-condition screening result: no rotational spectrum, doublet splitting, aplanar geometry or transition network is calculated.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- Relativistic mean-field Lagrangian with PK1; authors state NL3 and PC-PK1 give similar conclusions but only PK1 results are shown.
- 12 fermion and 20 meson harmonic-oscillator shells.
- Pairing neglected because of Pauli blocking.
- Both adiabatic and configuration-fixed constraints; `β` scanned and `γ` minimized.
- Valence protons referenced to `Z=82`; valence neutrons to `N=114`, except the grouped low-`j` `(fp)` subshells.
- No cranking frequency, angular-momentum orientation, symmetry restoration or laboratory-frame band calculation.

## Key Results

| GT22-3 | The displayed favorable triaxial region is `15°≤γ≤45°`; blue-star minima additionally require a suitable unpaired high-`j` configuration. | model-selection | direct | PDF pp.2-3; Figs.1-2 | true |
| GT22-4 | Multiple triaxial local minima occur in `192-198Tl`, which the authors treat as examples of triaxial shape coexistence. | model-result | direct | PDF p.3; Figs.1-2 | true |
| GT22-5 | `199Tl` and `200Tl` have no suitable triaxial minimum in this calculation and are ruled out from the proposed candidate set, despite known high-`j` bands. | model-null-result | direct | PDF p.3; Figs.1-2 | true |
| GT22-6 | Candidate minima in odd-odd `192,194,196,198Tl` repeatedly have unpaired `πh9/2⊗νi13/2^-1`. | model-result | direct | PDF pp.5,7; Table 1 | true |
| GT22-7 | `192Tl` D*/H* have `(β,γ)=(0.21,39.84°)` and `(0.16,26.17°)`; their common unpaired pair but different total occupations/deformations motivates a two-pair MχD prediction distinct from the same-configuration `103Rh` mechanism. | model-interpretation | direct | PDF pp.5,7; Table 1 | true |
| GT22-8 | `194Tl` C*/H* have `(0.14,36.81°)` and `(0.17,18.80°)` with `πh9/2⊗νi13/2^-1`; I* at `(0.13,45.19°)` is a higher four-quasiparticle `πh9/2⊗ν(i13/2)^-3` candidate. | model-result | direct | PDF pp.5,7; Table 1 | true |
| GT22-9 | `196Tl` A*/E*/H* have `(0.13,34.88°)`, `(0.18,37.26°)` and `(0.12,42.75°)` with the same unpaired high-`j` pair, motivating three predicted doublets/six `ΔI=1` bands. | model-interpretation | direct | PDF pp.5,7; Table 1 | true |
| GT22-10 | `198Tl` B*/F* have `(0.11,39.43°)` and `(0.16,43.32°)` with `πh9/2⊗νi13/2^-1`; the authors connect them to the already reported pair and predict MχD. | model-interpretation | direct | PDF pp.5,7; Table 1 | true |
| GT22-11 | `193Tl` has five predicted candidate configurations: three positive-parity `πh9/2⊗ν(fp)^1i13/2^-1` and two negative-parity `πh9/2⊗ν(i13/2)^-2` cases. | model-result | direct | PDF pp.6-8; Table 2 | true |
| GT22-12 | `195Tl` has two positive-parity `πh9/2⊗ν(fp)^1i13/2^-1` and one negative-parity `πh9/2⊗ν(i13/2)^-2` candidate; its known five-quasiparticle bands are outside the present calculation. | model-result-boundary | direct | PDF pp.6,8; Table 2 | true |
| GT22-13 | `197Tl` has three positive-parity `πh9/2⊗ν(fp)^1i13/2^-1` candidates plus negative-parity `πh9/2⊗ν(i13/2)^-2` and `πi13/2⊗ν(fp)^1i13/2^-1` candidates. | model-result | direct | PDF pp.6,8; Table 2 | true |
| GT22-14 | The observed `197Tl` B2/B3 pair is assigned the last configuration, but missing `B(M1)/B(E2)` values leave its chirality open. | secondary-systematics | indirect | PDF pp.8-9; Fig.4 | true |
| GT22-15 | Experimental energy and ratio trends in `192,196Tl` are said to follow adjacent `194,198Tl` systematics, motivating partner searches; these comparisons do not establish the missing bands. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.7-8; Fig.4(a-h) | true |
| GT22-16 | Low-`j` neutron occupations are deliberately grouped as `(fp)` because `3p3/2`, `3p1/2` and `2f5/2` cannot be distinguished reliably; the high-`j` occupations control the classification. | model-boundary | direct | PDF p.4 | true |
| GT22-17 | Multiple favorable static minima are necessary-condition evidence only; the calculation does not generate rotational partner bands, aplanar angular-momentum geometry, tunnelling, splittings or electromagnetic strengths. | evidence-boundary | synthesis | Full paper | true |
| GT22-18 | Pairing is omitted, and the claim that NL3/PC-PK1 yield similar conclusions is not documented with corresponding tables or curves. | model-boundary | direct | PDF p.2 | true |

## Candidate-Minimum Map

| Nucleus | Candidate minima / configuration | Calibrated status |
|---|---|---|
| `192Tl` | D*/H*, `πh9/2⊗νi13/2^-1` | two model minima; two doublets predicted, none calculated |
| `193Tl` | 3 positive `(fp)i13/2^-1` + 2 negative `(i13/2)^-2` cases | five model candidate pairs |
| `194Tl` | C*/H* two-quasiparticle + I* four-quasiparticle | observed literature candidate plus further model possibilities |

| `196Tl` | A*/E*/H*, common unpaired high-`j` pair | three predicted doublets |
| `197Tl` | 3 positive + 2 negative three-quasiparticle cases | five predicted doublets; observed B2/B3 remains open |
| `198Tl` | B*/F*, common unpaired high-`j` pair | reported literature pair plus a second predicted pair |
| `199Tl` | no suitable minimum | model null control |
| `200Tl` | no suitable minimum | model null control |

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- A static constrained minimum does not show that a stable rotational band exists or that two bands are quantum chiral partners.
- `γ` is a model coordinate, and the shaded `15°-45°` region is a selection convention rather than an experimental observable.
- Shape coexistence is inferred from one mean-field energy landscape; softness, mixing and pairing could reorganize shallow minima.
- The `(fp)` grouping prevents orbital-specific assignments for the low-`j` spectator neutron.
- Existing `193-195,198Tl` candidates are cited as context and are not independent confirmations produced by this work.
- No predicted partner-resolved energies or transition probabilities are available for experimental falsification beyond broad configuration/minimum targeting.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | Audit item | Agent judgment | Evidence / locator | review_status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The robust output is a map of favorable constrained minima and occupations, not a map of calculated chiral bands. | GT22-2 to GT22-6, GT22-17 | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | MχD semantics | Multiple minima motivate multiple searches, but each predicted doublet still requires an experimentally linked band pair and rotational quantum calculation. | GT22-7 to GT22-13, GT22-17 | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Null controls | `199,200Tl` are valuable model-specific negative cases, not universal exclusions of chirality under other functionals/pairing treatments. | GT22-5, GT22-18 | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Experimental gate | The strongest follow-up is partner-resolved spectroscopy with lifetimes/branching and configuration-sensitive calculations for `192,196,197Tl`. | GT22-14/15/17 | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Transfer boundary | Do not resolve `(fp)` orbit labels or claim five-quasiparticle coverage in `195Tl`; both exceed the paper's model space. | GT22-12/16 | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research decision | Persist nine lightweight isotope pages and theory/concept links, but create no band page from unobserved minima. | Full paper | unreviewed |

### Companion Evidence Audit

- New levels, transitions or lifetimes: `none`.
- Deformation minima and occupations: `self-consistent constrained-RMF results`.
- Existing Tl bands and ratios: `secondary imported evidence`.
- Rotational doublets, handed geometry and tunnelling: `not calculated`.
- `199,200Tl` exclusion: `model-specific null result`.

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Effect: extends the corpus from interpreting observed doublets to a full `192-200Tl` theory-screening chain, including positive and negative controls.
- Persistence: source; lightweight pages for all nine isotopes; update MχD, triaxial-shape-coexistence, CDFT and the corpus project. No experiment or band page is created.
- Review state: all `GT22-*` and AR claims remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence gate.

## Human Review Triage

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **GT22-3/17 — candidate criterion.** Keep the favorable γ window and suitable occupations separate from an actual rotational chiral solution.
- **GT22-7 to GT22-13 — predicted pair counts.** These are counts inferred from minima, not observed or calculated doublet bands.
- **GT22-12 — `195Tl` model-space boundary.** The known five-quasiparticle system is explicitly unavailable here.
- **GT22-14/15 — secondary evidence.** Do not count Fig.4 as a new experimental dataset.
- **GT22-16 — `(fp)` notation.** Do not silently assign a specific low-`j` orbital.

### P2/P3

- P2: return to the original `193-195,198Tl` experiments before numerical reuse of Fig.4.
- P3: test the minima with pairing-inclusive CDFT and a rotational quantum model that predicts spectra and matrix elements.
