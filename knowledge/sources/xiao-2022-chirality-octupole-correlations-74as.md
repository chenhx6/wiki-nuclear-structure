# Chirality and Octupole Correlations in `74As`

## Bibliographic Record

Physical Review C 106, 064302 (2022), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevC.106.064302`. The protected BibTeX key is `xiao_2022_Chiralityoctupole`.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: all nine PDF pages; full Table I; level scheme and gated spectra; ADO/polarization logic; revised spins; Bands 1-3; configuration argument; energy/`S(I)`/`B(M1)/B(E2)` comparisons; TPRM inputs and angular-momentum components; E1 links, `B(E1)/B(E2)` and `δE` octupole comparison.
- Not covered: raw coincidence matrices, the detailed setup paper cited as Ref.24, original Refs.25-32 level assignments, lifetime measurements, or the previous RMF calculation beyond the parameters quoted here.
- Coverage caveat: the source interprets Bands 1/2 as chiral doublets and Band 1/3 E1 systematics as octupole correlations. These remain experiment-model interpretations, not direct observations of handed geometry or stable octupole deformation.

## Extracted Pages

- PDF pp.1-3: motivation, reaction/detector setup, complete transition table and level scheme.
- PDF pp.4-5: gated spectra, new Band 2/Band 3 links, missing low-energy gap, multipolarity method, revised-spin systematics and same-configuration argument.
- PDF pp.6-7: experimental fingerprints, TPRM inputs/fits/angular-momentum geometry, E1/`B(E1)/B(E2)`/`δE` analysis and summary.
- PDF pp.8-9: references.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

The experiment asks whether a new positive-parity side band in `74As` forms a chiral doublet with the yrast positive-parity band and whether links to a negative-parity band establish octupole correlations, thereby extending the lower-`Z` boundary of the A≈80 chirality region (PDF p.1).

## Experimental Design Logic

- Populate `74As` via `74Ge(4He,1p3n)` at `58.6` and `62.6 MeV`, recording about `1.9×10^9` γ-γ coincidences with AFRODITE clovers plus LEPS detectors (PDF pp.1,3-4).
- Use coincidence relations to extend Band 1, establish Band 2 and distinguish the close `894.1/895.0-keV` lines; use ADO and clover polarization asymmetry to constrain multipolarities (PDF pp.3-5; Figs.1-3).
- Reassign the Band-1 spins one unit higher than Ref.32 and test that choice through `70,72,74As` yrast-energy systematics (PDF p.5; Fig.4).
- Compare Bands 1/2 through energy separation, `S(I)`, branching-derived `B(M1)/B(E2)` and a TPRM calculation; inspect calculated principal-axis angular-momentum components (PDF pp.5-7; Figs.5-6).
- Diagnose Band 1/3 reflection-asymmetric correlations from three E1 links plus relative `B(E1)/B(E2)` and `δE`, using `78Br` correlations and stable-octupole `224Th` as contrasting references (PDF p.7; Fig.7).

## Summary

The experiment identifies two positive-parity and one negative-parity `ΔI=1` bands in `74As`. Band 2 is established and linked to Band 1 by four `M1/E2` plus one E2 transition, supporting a common `πg9/2⊗νg9/2` assignment. Their separation stays near `400 keV`; `S(I)` values and branching-derived `B(M1)/B(E2)` are similar, and a fitted TPRM reproduces these trends. The model gives an aplanar total angular momentum but a nonideal geometry because the neutron angular momentum is spread across all three axes. Three E1 transitions connect negative-parity Band 3 to Band 1; their relative `B(E1)/B(E2)` and `δE` resemble `78Br` and differ strongly from stable-octupole `224Th`, supporting octupole correlations rather than stable deformation. Band 3's `π(f5/2/p3/2)⊗νg9/2` assignment is tentative.

## Experimental Setup

- Beam/reaction: `4He` at `58.6` and `62.6 MeV`; `74Ge(4He,1p3n)74As`.
- Target: `2.85 mg/cm²` `74Ge` with `10.8 mg/cm²` carbon backing.
- Array: eight Compton-suppressed AFRODITE clovers and two LEPS detectors; four clovers at `135°`, four clovers plus both LEPS at `90°`.
- Calibration: standard `152Eu` source.
- Statistics: approximately `1.9×10^9` γ-γ coincidence events.
- Products: one symmetric coincidence matrix and several asymmetric ADO/polarization matrices.
- Geometry calibration quoted by the paper: `R_ADO≈1.2` for stretched quadrupoles or `ΔI=0` dipoles and `≈0.8` for stretched pure dipoles; positive `A_p` for stretched electric or `ΔI=0` magnetic and negative `A_p` for stretched magnetic transitions.

| XA22-3 | Band 2 feeds Band 1 through five links: four `ΔI=1 M1/E2` and one `ΔI=2 E2`, which the authors use to support a common configuration. | transition-network | direct | PDF pp.3,5; Fig.1 | true |
| XA22-4 | The close `894.1-keV` Band-3 and `895.0-keV` Band-2 transitions are distinguished by separate gates. | coincidence-evidence | direct | PDF pp.4-5; Fig.3 | true |
| XA22-5 | Four new cross-parity decay paths are identified at `372.4, 774.9, 919.4, 1293.4 keV`; only the latter three connect Band 3 to Band 1. | transition-network | direct | PDF pp.3-5,7; Figs.1-3 | true |
| XA22-6 | For the low-lying `372.4-keV` link, `R_ADO=0.75(6)` and `A_p=+0.06(5)` support E1 character and a `6+` final state. | multipolarity-assignment | direct | PDF pp.2,5; Table I | true |
| XA22-7 | Energy conservation leaves an unresolved `≈11.8-keV` gap between the `4+` isomer and the final state of the `55-keV` transition. | level-scheme-boundary | direct | PDF pp.3,5; Fig.1 | true |
| XA22-8 | Band-1 spins are assigned `1ℏ` higher than Ref.32; smoother `70,72,74As` yrast-energy systematics support but do not independently prove the revision. | spin-assignment | indirect | PDF p.5; Fig.4 | true |
| XA22-9 | Bands 1/2 are assigned `πg9/2⊗νg9/2` because of the five linking transitions and the earlier Band-1 assignment. | configuration-assignment | indirect | PDF p.5 | true |
| XA22-10 | The two bands remain about `400 keV` apart, have similar smooth `S(I)` and close odd-even-staggering `B(M1)/B(E2)` ratios; the authors call them chiral partners. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.6; Fig.5 | true |
| XA22-11 | The TPRM fixes `β2=0.37` from earlier RMF, adjusts `γ=21.6°` and `J=12ℏ²/MeV` to the spectra/ratios, and places the neutron Fermi surface between `[422]5/2` and `[413]7/2`. | model-input | direct | PDF p.6 | true |
| XA22-12 | The fitted TPRM reproduces the pair energies, `S(I)`, and the magnitude/staggering phase of `B(M1)/B(E2)`, so it is supportive but not an independent parameter-free test. | model-data-comparison | indirect | PDF p.6; Fig.5 | true |
| XA22-13 | In the TPRM, core and proton angular momenta favor intermediate and short axes, while the neutron is strongly mixed across all axes; total `I` remains aplanar but the ideal chiral trihedron is not realized. | model-geometry | direct | PDF pp.6-7; Fig.6 | true |
| XA22-14 | Three new `774.9, 919.4, 1293.4-keV` E1 transitions link Band 3 to Band 1 and provide the direct transition network for the octupole-correlation interpretation. | transition-network | direct | PDF pp.3,7; Figs.1,7 | true |
| XA22-15 | Relative `B(E1)/B(E2)` and `δE` for Bands 1/3 resemble `78Br` but differ substantially from stable-octupole `224Th`, supporting correlations while arguing against a stable-octupole reading. | comparative-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.7; Fig.7 | true |
| XA22-16 | Band 3 is tentatively assigned `π(f5/2/p3/2)⊗νg9/2`, motivated by the proton `g9/2↔p3/2` octupole-coupling region near `Z=34`. | configuration-assignment | indirect | PDF p.7 | true |
| XA22-17 | No lifetimes or absolute E1/M1/E2 strengths are measured; the transition-probability ratios are branching-based fingerprints. | evidence-boundary | synthesis | PDF pp.2,6-7; Figs.5,7 | true |
| XA22-18 | Extending the A≈80 chiral-island boundary to `Z=33` is the authors' classification based on this candidate evidence, not a model-independent boundary measurement. | author-interpretation | direct | PDF pp.1,7 | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

| Structure | Experimental content | Interpretation boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Band 1 | positive-parity yrast sequence extended to `(16+)`; spins revised upward by `1ℏ` | earlier `πg9/2⊗νg9/2` assignment retained |
| Band 2 | positive-parity side band from `9+` to `(14+)`, five new in-band transitions and five links to Band 1 | common configuration and chiral partnership inferred |
| Band 3 | negative-parity sequence through `14−`; three direct E1 links to Band 1 | tentative `π(f5/2/p3/2)⊗νg9/2`; octupole correlations, not stable deformation |

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- An approximately `400-keV` separation is compatible with a candidate doublet but not close degeneracy in the strict static limit.
- The TPRM `γ` and moment of inertia are adjusted to the same spectra/ratios used for comparison; the geometry is model support rather than a direct measurement.
- The calculated neutron vector is not localized on the long axis, weakening the ideal particle-core-hole trihedron even though total rotation is aplanar.
- Band 3 contains unresolved `f5/2/p3/2` proton content, and the octupole mechanism is inferred from systematics rather than a dedicated reflection-asymmetric calculation for `74As`.
- Relative E1/E2 ratios and `δE` distinguish correlations from the `224Th` stable benchmark, but no lifetime establishes absolute E1 collectivity.
- The `≈11.8-keV` unobserved low-energy gap and revised spin scale should be preserved in any detailed level-scheme reuse.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | Audit item | Agent judgment | Evidence / locator | review_status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The strongest experimental additions are Band 2, its five-link network to Band 1, and three Band-3→Band-1 E1 links. | XA22-2 to XA22-6, XA22-14 | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | Chirality gate | Energies/ratios plus a fitted aplanar TPRM make Bands 1/2 a substantive candidate, but not a model-independent confirmation. | XA22-9 to XA22-13, XA22-17 | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Octupole gate | Band 1/3 support correlations; their clear deviation from `224Th` is affirmative evidence against upgrading to stable octupole deformation. | XA22-14/15/17 | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Geometry tension | The neutron's three-axis mixing should be reported together with the aplanar total-I result, not omitted from the idealized chiral picture. | XA22-13 | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Reuse boundary | Preserve the one-unit spin revision and `11.8-keV` gap whenever transcribing the level scheme. | XA22-7/8 | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research decision | Persist one chiral-candidate pair, one octupole-correlated negative-parity band and one experiment; do not create a stable-octupole or MχD claim. | Full paper | unreviewed |

### Companion Evidence Audit

- New coincidence-linked bands/transitions: `direct experimental evidence`.
- Spin/parity: `ADO/polarization plus systematics`; one low-energy gap remains unresolved.
- `B(M1)/B(E2)` and `B(E1)/B(E2)`: `branching-derived relative fingerprints`, not absolute strengths.
- Aplanar angular momentum: `fitted TPRM result`.
- Octupole correlations: `experiment-systematics interpretation`; stable deformation not supported.

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Effect: adds the first `Z=33` A≈80 chiral candidate in the corpus and an explicit correlation-versus-stable-octupole benchmark.
- Persistence: source; `74As`; two band pages; one iThemba-AFRODITE experiment; update chirality, chiral-doublet, octupole-correlation/deformation, TPRM and the corpus project.
- Review state: all `XA22-*` and AR claims remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence gate.

## Human Review Triage

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **XA22-5/14 — E1 counting.** Keep the three Band-3→Band-1 E1 links separate from the additional low-lying `372.4-keV` cross-parity transition.
- **XA22-7/8 — level-scheme anchors.** Preserve the missing `11.8-keV` gap and the one-unit spin revision.
- **XA22-11/12 — fit dependence.** `γ` and `J` are adjusted to the same data used as model support.
- **XA22-13 — nonideal geometry.** Do not report only “aplanar”; the neutron is mixed across all axes.
- **XA22-15/17 — octupole terminology.** Relative fingerprints support correlations but explicitly differ from stable `224Th`.

### P2/P3

- P2: verify the revised spins and transition branches against the original high-spin Ref.32 before precision reuse.
- P3: obtain partner-resolved lifetimes and a reflection-asymmetric model for absolute E1/M1/E2 and geometry tests.
