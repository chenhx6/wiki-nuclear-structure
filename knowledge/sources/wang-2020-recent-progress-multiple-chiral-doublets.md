# Recent Progress in Multiple Chiral Doublet Bands

## Bibliographic Record

Chinese Physics C 44(11), 112001 (2020), DOI `10.1088/1674-1137/abaed2`. The protected BibTeX key is `wang_2020_Recentprogress`. The repository PDF is the arXiv-layout version `arXiv:2009.02864v1` and carries stale template footer text; final bibliographic metadata come from the protected record.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: all nine PDF pages; experimental MχD table, predicted-nucleus table, theory taxonomy, ideal same-configuration PRM transition rules, approximate interaction-strength reconstruction, octupole/CPQ and pseudospin-related perspectives, summary and references.
- Evidence role: review/theory taxonomy and provenance map. Its experiment rows and nucleus-level interpretations are secondary and do not add independent confirmation to the cited original sources.
- Coverage caveat: Table 1 contains at least one reaction typo for `136Nd`; several future topics are model proposals/conjectures rather than observed structures.

## Extracted Pages

- PDF pp.1-2: introduction, experimental MχD survey and Table 1.
- PDF pp.3-4: Table 2 theoretical predictions, model approaches and start of ideal-PRM selection rules.
- PDF p.5: transition rules, approximate inter-doublet interaction and chiral-wobbler conjecture.
- PDF p.6: octupole/CPQ, `124Cs`, candidate cores and pseudospin-triplet discussion.
- PDF p.7: summary and references.
- PDF pp.8-9: references.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

The review organizes how MχD moved from constrained-RMF prediction to experiment and then to same-configuration, octupole-correlated and other coupled-mode extensions. It also asks what ideal electromagnetic relations might distinguish multiple doublets and what future systems could host parity, pseudospin or wobbling extensions.

## Summary

Wang separates MχD into doublets built on distinct configurations/deformations and doublets assigned the same configuration. Eight experimental candidate nuclei are tabulated at the review's cutoff, while a larger Table 2 lists calculated triaxial minima as search targets. An ideal triaxial-PRM example supplies in-band/interband/linking transition rules and predicts weak cross-doublet strengths; these are model-conditional results, not universal selection rules. Octupole, CPQ, pseudospin and “chiral wobbler” sections are primarily perspectives and require original-source/model checks.

## Key Results

| ID | Statement | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| WA20-1 | Table 1 lists eight observed MχD candidate nuclei at the review's cutoff: `78Br`, `103Rh`, `105Rh`, `107Ag`, `133Ce`, `135Nd`, `136Nd` and `195Tl`. | literature-census | indirect | PDF pp.1-2; Table 1 | true |
| WA20-2 | The review divides observed MχD into distinct-configuration/deformation cases and an identical-configuration category represented by `103Rh`. | review-taxonomy | indirect | PDF p.2, Sec.2 | true |
| WA20-3 | The author notes that all Table-1 candidates were produced by fusion-evaporation in-beam γ spectroscopy and involve high-j intruder orbitals; low-j orbitals are described as usually spectator components. | literature-synthesis | indirect | PDF p.2, after Table 1 | true |
| WA20-4 | Table 2 compiles predicted local triaxial minima in Co, Br, Rb, Rh, Ag and Cs nuclei; these are theoretical candidate configurations, not observed MχD pairs. | theory-census | indirect | PDF pp.3-4; Table 2 | true |
| WA20-5 | Most Table-2 candidate configurations are stated to lie below `3 MeV`, motivating experimental population searches, although the table also contains much higher calculated minima. | model-result | indirect | PDF p.4, Sec.3; Table 2 | true |
| WA20-6 | The review lists triaxial PRM, PRM+RMF, TAC+collective Hamiltonian, projected shell model and 3D TAC-CDFT as MχD approaches; 3D TAC-CDFT is highlighted for `106Rh`. | review-background | indirect | PDF pp.2-4, Sec.3 | true |
| WA20-7 | Seven ideal single-doublet fingerprints are listed: near degeneracy, spin-independent `S(I)`, similar alignments, similar `B(M1)`/`B(E2)`, `B(M1)` staggering, vanishing high-spin interband E2 and small interaction. | review-background | indirect | PDF p.4, Sec.4 | true |
| WA20-8 | For distinct-configuration MχD, the review says the standard fingerprints should be tested separately for each pair. | evidence-boundary | direct | PDF p.4, Sec.4 | true |
| WA20-9 | An ideal `πh11/2⊗νh11/2^-1`, `γ=90°` PRM example predicts common in-band M1 staggering and specific alternating interband/linking M1 rules for two same-configuration doublets. | model-result | indirect | PDF pp.4-5; Fig.1; Ref.63 | true |
| WA20-10 | In the same ideal calculation, each doublet has comparable in-band strengths, whereas transitions connecting the excited and lowest doublets are about two orders of magnitude weaker. | model-result | indirect | PDF p.5, Sec.4 | true |
| WA20-11 | Inter-doublet E2 links imply that cross-paired Bands 2/3 are not ideal chiral partners; an average interaction `V≈200 keV` is reconstructed using a two-band mixing equation and calculated PRM inputs. | model-result | indirect | PDF p.5, Eq.1 and surrounding text | true |
| WA20-12 | The review explicitly calls the `V` reconstruction approximate because Eq.1 assumes a two-band mixing picture while the chiral geometry contains vibrational mixing. | model-boundary | direct | PDF p.5, after Eq.1 | true |
| WA20-13 | Ideal-PRM mixing calculations give about `1%` and `2%` E2 admixtures for in-doublet ΔI=1 links and about `20%` for links between the two doublets; a core-wobbling interpretation is presented as a conjecture requiring further study. | future-proposal | indirect | PDF p.5, Sec.4 | true |
| WA20-14 | `78Br` is reviewed as MχD with octupole correlations and motivation for chirality-parity quartets, but the review states that CPQ bands had not been experimentally observed. | evidence-boundary | indirect | PDF pp.5-6, Sec.5 | true |
| WA20-15 | `124Cs` is cited as a positive-parity chiral-vibration candidate coexisting with E1/octupole correlations; the cited lifetime work reports `B(E1)` of order `10^-4 W.u.`. | literature-synthesis | indirect | PDF p.6, Sec.5 | true |
| WA20-16 | Macroscopic-microscopic PES calculations are cited to propose even-even Se/Ba/Ra cores with simultaneous triaxial and octupole minima for future CPQ searches. | future-proposal | indirect | PDF p.6; Fig.2 | true |
| WA20-17 | A model study of `105Ag` triplet bands is summarized as overlapping pseudospin and chiral pairings and as motivation for chirality-pseudospin triplet/quartet searches. | literature-synthesis | indirect | PDF p.6, Sec.5 | true |
| WA20-18 | Table 1 prints `100Mo(40Ar,5n)` for `136Nd`; mass conservation and the original Petrache 2018 experiment require `(4n)`, so the review row is not reliable reaction provenance. | source-error | direct | PDF p.2, Table 1 versus [[petrache-2018-chiral-bands-even-even-136nd]] PE18-1 | true |

## Theoretical Taxonomy and Reuse Rules

1. Apply experimental fingerprints pair by pair before making a nucleus-level MχD statement.
2. Separate observed-band tables from predicted local-minimum tables; an asterisk marks configurations already associated with experiment, not confirmation of every predicted pair.
3. Treat ideal-PRM transition rules as conditional on its fixed configuration, `γ`, inertial and electromagnetic inputs.
4. Keep cross-doublet E2 admixture, interaction strength and core-wobbling interpretation at model/conjecture level until a real nucleus supplies corresponding absolute matrix elements.
5. Use original experiments for reactions and band/configuration facts; Table 1's `136Nd` error demonstrates why.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- Review counts inherit the original papers' candidate criteria and evidence dependencies.
- “Confirmation of triaxial shape coexistence” and “robustness” wording is the review's synthesis, not a new shape measurement.
- Table-2 minima establish calculated triaxial configurations, not quantum chiral doublets or their observability.
- The `γ=90°` ideal PRM result is a special model case and its selection rules need not survive configuration mixing, γ softness or realistic electromagnetic operators.
- The two-band interaction equation is approximate for a four-band MχD space.
- CPQ, chiral wobblers and chirality-pseudospin multiplets are perspective targets in this review; later original experiments must be learned independently.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | Audit item | Agent judgment | Evidence / locator | review_status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The lasting contribution is a 2020 MχD taxonomy plus ideal-model test menu, not a new experimental census validation. | WA20-1 to WA20-10 | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | Evidence independence | Table 1 must be counted by original experimental lineage, not as eight review-level confirmations. | WA20-1/18 | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Prediction semantics | Table 2 is a local-minimum search map; it does not establish band pairs, transition strengths or chiral tunnelling. | WA20-4/5 | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Same-configuration discriminator | Weak cross-doublet strengths and alternating link rules are useful hypotheses, but the ideal fixed model is too narrow to serve as a universal selection rule. | WA20-9 to WA20-13 | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Coupled-mode boundary | CPQ, pseudospin multiplets and chiral wobblers remain distinct proposed extensions and must not be merged by shared “quartet” language. | WA20-13 to WA20-17 | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research decision | Persist one review source and update concept/project taxonomy; do not create pages for every predicted nucleus or secondary experiment row. | Full paper | unreviewed |

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Effect: `organizes` experimental/theory MχD categories and `limits` reuse of ideal-model rules and secondary reaction tables.
- Persistence: source; update MχD, chirality-parity and pseudospin-chiral concepts plus nuclear-chirality project/index.
- No nucleus, band or experiment page is created from this review alone.
- Review state: all `WA20-*` and AR claims remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence gate.

## Human Review Triage

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **WA20-1/18 — census/provenance.** Confirm the eight-name cutoff and retain the `136Nd (5n)` table error.
- **WA20-4/5 — prediction table.** Do not convert calculated minima into experimental candidates.
- **WA20-9 to WA20-13 — ideal model.** Preserve `γ=90°`, fixed inputs, two-band approximation and conjectural chiral-wobbler step.
- **WA20-14 to WA20-17 — coupled modes.** CPQ/pseudospin/wobbling items are secondary perspectives, not new observations.
