# Gray et al. (2020): Hyperfine Fields and `g`-Factor Measurements

## Bibliographic Record

T. J. Gray et al., *Physical Review C* **101**, 054302 (2020), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevC.101.054302`, citation key `gray_2020_Hyperfinefields`.

The raw PDF is `504751` bytes with local timestamp `2026-07-01 01:56:26`; SHA-256 is recorded above.

## Scope and Reading Depth

Full PDF text layer was read across pp.1--10. Verification focused on the abstract, experimental setup, the `R(t)` formalism, the amplitude discussion in Sec.VB, the host-comparison boundary, and the conclusion.

This is an `experiment-ingest + method-ingest + project-ingest` source. Its primary subject is TDPAD hyperfine-field / `g`-factor work in Fe and Gd hosts. For the current `sigma-over-i` project, it is a boundary example showing that an empirical alignment expectation can fail in a host-specific isomer / hyperfine-field context.

## Summary

The paper studies `66Ga`, `67Ge`, and `69Ge` isomers recoil-implanted into iron and gadolinium hosts at about `6 K`, using Time Differential Perturbed Angular Distribution (TDPAD) to determine hyperfine magnetic fields and measure `g` factors. The authors conclude that gadolinium can serve as a suitable host for precision TDPAD `g`-factor work under controlled conditions, and they report new `g`-factor values consistent with previous literature.

For the current project, the key point is the amplitude analysis: the paper compares measured `R(t)` amplitudes with empirical alignment expectations and concludes that the produced alignment is significantly lower than the empirically expected `sigma/I ≈ 0.35`. If one assumes `100%` full-field implantation sites, the observed amplitudes would require `sigma/I ≈ 0.9`. The authors warn that `R(t)` amplitude alone is not a reliable measure of field-free fraction unless the alignment is independently constrained.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- Four runs at the ANU Heavy Ion Accelerator Facility with pulsed `48 MeV` `12C` and `60 MeV` `16O` beams.
- Reaction/target combinations include `56Fe(12C,pn)66Ga`, `54,56Fe(16O,2pn)67,69Ge`, and `54Fe(16O,2pn)67Ge`.
- Host foils were iron or gadolinium, polarized by an external `~0.1 T` field and cooled to `5.7(1) K`.
- Two HPGe and two LaBr3 detectors were used in runs 1, 2, and 4; four LaBr3 detectors in run 3.
- The measured observables are time-dependent perturbed angular distributions `R(t)`, from which Larmor frequencies, hyperfine fields, and `g` factors are extracted.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| G20-1 | 本文把 `66Ga`, `67Ge`, `69Ge` isomers recoil-implant 到 `Fe` 和 `Gd` ferromagnetic hosts（约 `6 K`），并用 TDPAD 测量 hyperfine magnetic fields；同时给出 `g(66Ga,7-) = +0.126(4)`、`g(67Ge,9/2+) = -0.1932(22)` 和 `g(67Ge)/g(69Ge) = 0.869(9)`。 | observed-fact | direct | Abstract; p.8, Sec.VI | false |
| G20-2 | TDPAD 分析中构造 `R(t) = (N1-N2)/(N1+N2) ≈ [3a2/(4+a2)] sin(2ωL t)`，其中 `a2 = A2 B2`，`B2` 表示 isomeric state 的 spin alignment，`ωL` 与 `g` 和 `Bhf` 相关。 | method-formalism | direct | p.3, Sec.III, Eqs.1--2 | false |
| G20-3 | 若有比例 `p` 的 implantation 位点为 low-field 或 field-free，`R(t)` 振幅会按 `R(t) ≈ (1-p)[3a2/(4+a2)] sin(2ωL t)` 缩小；因此只有在 alignment 已知时，`R(t)` 振幅才能被安全用于估计 field-free fraction。 | method-formalism | direct | p.4, Sec.III, Eq.3 and following text | false |
| G20-4 | 论文把 fusion-evaporation 后的 nuclear alignment 经验地写成 oblate Gaussian `m`-substate distribution，典型 standard deviation 为 `sigma ≈ 0.35 I`；作者把这条经验规则当作估计 `B2` 与 `a2` 的背景。 | experimental-practice | direct | p.4, Sec.III, text after Eq.3 | false |
| G20-5 | 本文观测到的初始 `R(t)` amplitudes 在不同案例间彼此相近，也与先前 Fe/Cu host 的 full-alignment-style amplitudes 相近。 | observed-fact | direct | p.7, Sec.VB, first two paragraphs | false |
| G20-6 | 作者据 `R(t)` amplitudes 解释：这些 isomeric states 的 alignment 明显低于经验预期 `sigma/I ≈ 0.35`；若假设 `100%` full-field implantation sites，则需要 `sigma/I ≈ 0.9` 才能解释 Fig.3、6、7 的 amplitudes。 | author-interpretation | direct | Abstract; p.7, Sec.VB | false |
| G20-7 | 作者强调 `R(t)` 单独并不是可靠的 field-free fraction 指标；需要 external-field measurement、对 full-field-site amplitude 的独立标定，或对附近非 isomeric states 的 angular-distribution measurement 来验证 nuclear alignment。 | author-interpretation | direct | p.7, Sec.VB; p.8, Sec.VI | false |
| G20-8 | 本文进一步警告，经验规则 `sigma/I ≈ 0.35` 源自 prompt decays；若直接把它套用于可能具有不同 feeding pattern 的 isomeric states，需要谨慎。 | author-interpretation | direct | p.7, Sec.VB, paragraph beginning "The empirical rule..." | false |
| G20-9 | 对 gadolinium hosts，作者认为在较低 beam intensity 和稳定条件下可以得到可重复的 `Bhf` 分布，并据此认为 Gd 可作为 precision TDPAD `g`-factor measurement 的合适 host。 | author-interpretation | direct | Abstract; p.8, Secs.VC and VI | false |

## Nuclear Structure Information

This source is not mainly a level-scheme paper. Its nucleus-specific structure content is limited to the isomer properties used for the TDPAD and `g`-factor analyses, plus the configuration interpretation supported by the measured `g` factors.

## Authors' Interpretation

- The measured `g` factors support the `[pi f5/2 ⊗ nu g9/2]7-` assignment for the `66Ga` isomer.
- The reduced `R(t)` amplitudes are interpreted primarily as an alignment issue rather than direct evidence for large field-free fractions.
- Gadolinium is interpreted as a viable TDPAD host when beam conditions avoid the radiation-damage problems encountered in earlier work.

## Model Results

None in the shell-model / collective-structure sense. The paper uses empirical host/alloy arguments and magnetic-precession formalism rather than a dedicated nuclear-structure calculation.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- The source is a TDPAD / hyperfine-field / `g`-factor paper, not a P-ADO or mixing-ratio paper.
- The `sigma/I ≈ 0.35` statement is an empirical background rule imported into the amplitude discussion, not a directly measured universal constant.
- The stronger `sigma/I ≈ 0.9` inference depends on assuming `100%` full-field implantation sites.
- The host behavior is material-specific; Fe/Gd implantation-site physics and radiation-damage issues should not be generalized to all fusion-evaporation spectroscopy contexts.

## Project Relation

For [[sigma-over-i-uncertainty-in-pado-mixing-ratio-extraction]], this source provides a useful boundary case: even when an empirical alignment expectation such as `sigma/I ≈ 0.35` is common in practice, an actual isomeric TDPAD dataset can show substantially lower effective alignment and can require independent verification of what the amplitude means.

The boundary is equally important: this is not a direct angular-distribution or mixing-ratio extraction source. It should be cited as host- and method-specific evidence that empirical alignment assumptions may fail, not as a universal correction for P-ADO.

## Human Review Triage

- P0 focus resolved: `G20-4`, p.4 Sec.III. The paper presents `sigma ≈ 0.35 I` as an empirical alignment background for fusion-evaporation reactions, not as a measurement from this experiment.
- P0 focus resolved: `G20-6`, Abstract + p.7 Sec.VB. The Wiki keeps the "lower than expected" alignment statement and the inferred `sigma/I ≈ 0.9` explicitly tied to the `100%` full-field assumption.
- P0 focus resolved: `G20-7/G20-8`, p.7--8. The source explicitly warns against reading field-free fraction directly from `R(t)` amplitude and against blindly transferring the prompt-decay empirical rule to isomeric states.
- Remaining P0: none identified beyond the host-specific / empirical-rule boundary after the 2026-07-09 user review.
- P1: `G20-2/G20-3`, p.3--4, for the `R(t)` and amplitude formalism.
- P1: `G20-1`, Abstract / p.8, for the reported `g` values and overall host-comparison scope.
- P1: `G20-9`, p.8 conclusion, for the qualified statement that gadolinium can serve as a suitable TDPAD host.

## Personal Notes

This source is valuable to the project precisely because it is not a P-ADO paper. It shows that an empirical alignment-width expectation can fail in a nearby spectroscopy method, and that one must separate "reduced amplitude due to weaker alignment" from "reduced amplitude due to field-free sites" unless independent information is available.

Additional sigma-scale factors worth retaining from this source:

- `R(t)` amplitude depends on `A2 B2`, so the inferred alignment scale is coupled to both the transition anisotropy term and the state-alignment term.
- A field-free or low-field site fraction `p` suppresses the same amplitude, so weaker `R(t)` does not map one-to-one onto weaker alignment.
- The empirical `sigma/I ≈ 0.35` benchmark was built from prompt decays; isomeric feeding can populate different magnetic-substate patterns.
- Independent angular-distribution measurements on nearby non-isomeric states can provide an external alignment calibration.
- Host/site assumptions matter: full-field occupancy, host material, and beam-damage conditions all feed into the apparent sigma-scale inference.
