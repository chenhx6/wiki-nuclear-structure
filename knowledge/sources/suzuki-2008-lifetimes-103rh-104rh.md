# Lifetimes of Candidate Chiral Doublets in `103,104Rh`

## Bibliographic Record

Physical Review C 78, 031302(R) (2008), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevC.78.031302`. The protected BibTeX key is `suzuki_2008_Lifetimemeasurement`.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: all five PDF pages; motivation and chirality criteria; inverse-kinematics RDDS setup; direct- and indirect-feeding DDCM equations; Tables I-V; lifetime and reduced-probability extraction; staggering comparison; interpretation and requested future tests.
- Not covered: raw coincidence matrices, detector efficiency files, the earlier level-scheme papers that supply energies/branching ratios, or the cited particle-rotor calculations in their original sources.
- Coverage caveat: lifetimes are measured for only one member of each proposed doublet. The paper does not provide an absolute-strength comparison between partner bands.

## Extracted Pages

- PDF p.1: experimental chirality criteria, prior candidate context and configuration expectations.
- PDF p.2: `103,104Rh` energy/`S(I)` systematics, inverse-kinematics Gammasphere-plunger setup and DDCM equations.
- PDF p.3: RDDS spectra, Tables I-III, extracted lifetimes and absolute `B(M1)`/`B(E2)` values.
- PDF p.4: staggering systematics, comparison with A≈130 candidates, interpretation and explicit partner-band decision test.
- PDF p.5: references.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

The paper asks what absolute electromagnetic information can be obtained for the proposed `103Rh` and `104Rh` chiral doublets and whether the previously reported odd-even staggering of `B(M1)/B(E2)` originates in `B(M1)` or `B(E2)`. It frames two experimental requirements for chirality: nearly degenerate same-configuration `ΔI=1` bands and similar in-band/interband electromagnetic properties (PDF p.1).

## Method and Design Logic

- A `96Zr` beam at `330 MeV` on a thin `11B` target populates `103Rh` through 4n evaporation and `104Rh` through 3n evaporation in inverse kinematics (PDF p.2).
- Gammasphere plus the Cologne plunger separates shifted and unshifted components at seven target-degrader distances. A `93Nb` degrader reduces but does not stop the recoils (PDF pp.2-3; Fig.2).
- DDCM uses a direct feeding gate when clean. If that feeder is contaminated, an upper transition and an intensity correction are used (PDF p.2, Eqs.1-2).
- Lifetimes, prior branching ratios and an assumed pure-M1 character for `I→I-1` transitions yield absolute `B(M1)` and `B(E2)` values (PDF p.3; Tables I-III).

## Summary

Three candidate-band lifetimes in `103Rh` and five in `104Rh` are reported. In both nuclei `B(M1)` decreases with spin, while weak odd-even staggering lies in `B(E2)` and therefore drives the previously reported `B(M1)/B(E2)` staggering. This is a useful absolute-strength constraint, but not a completed chiral-partner test: the measured values belong to one candidate-band member in each nucleus, and the authors explicitly require higher-spin and partner-band lifetimes. They give conditional outcomes—convergent partner properties would support chiral rotation; persistent differences or absence of convergence would disfavor it (PDF p.4).

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- `11B(96Zr,4n)103Rh` and `11B(96Zr,3n)104Rh` at `330 MeV`, Argonne Tandem Linear Accelerator System.
- `300 μg/cm²` `11B` target deposited on `4 mg/cm²` `93Nb`; `3.5 mg/cm²` `93Nb` degrader.
- Gammasphere with 101 Compton-suppressed Ge detectors and Cologne plunger.
- Seven target-degrader distances from `8` to `100 μm`; about `4×10^8` unfolded twofold-or-higher events per distance.
- Mean velocities before the degrader: `β=5.1(1)%` (`103Rh`) and `5.7(3)%` (`104Rh`); after it: `3.1(1)%` and `3.3(2)%`.
- Seven forward/backward analysis rings at `35°, 50°, 58°, 122°, 130°, 146°, 163°`; middle rings serve only as cleaning gates for `104Rh` and are excluded for `103Rh` because of low statistics.

## Key Results

| ID | Statement | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SU08-1 | The single inverse-kinematics experiment populated `103Rh` and `104Rh` via 4n and 3n evaporation and measured shifted/unshifted γ components at seven distances. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.2 | true |
| SU08-2 | The degrader geometry enabled sub-picosecond sensitivity but deliberately did not stop the recoils; target/degrader transit was kept below `0.2 ps`. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.2 | true |
| SU08-3 | Direct-feeder DDCM and an intensity-corrected upper-gate variant were used; the latter supplies the starred `103Rh` lifetimes in Table I. | method-result | direct | PDF pp.2-3; Eqs.1-2; Table I | true |
| SU08-4 | `103Rh` Table I reports seven lifetimes, including candidate Band-3 values `0.99(27), 0.95(17), 1.0(1), 0.72(23) ps` for `23/2+` through `29/2+`. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.3; Table I | true |
| SU08-5 | `104Rh` lifetimes are `6.21(45), 1.25(9), 1.34(12), 1.05(10), 0.71(19) ps` for `9−` through `13−`. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.3; Table II | true |
| SU08-6 | Absolute `B(M1)`/`B(E2)` values are tabulated for `103Rh` Band 3 at `25/2+–29/2+` and for the measured `104Rh` sequence at `9−–13−`; no partner-band absolute strengths are tabulated. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.3; Table III | true |
| SU08-7 | The `B(M1)` extraction assumes pure M1 multipolarity and imports transition energies/branching ratios from earlier experiments. | model-boundary | direct | PDF p.3 | true |
| SU08-8 | In both nuclei `B(M1)` decreases with spin while `B(E2)` shows weak odd-even staggering; the ratio staggering is therefore attributed to `B(E2)`. | derived-observable | direct | PDF pp.3-4; Fig.3; Tables IV-V | true |
| SU08-9 | The measured staggering differs from cited A≈130 cases, where the authors report the dominant odd-even variation in `B(M1)` rather than `B(E2)`. | author-comparison | indirect | PDF p.4; Tables IV-V | true |
| SU08-10 | The observed bandheads, `23/2+` in `103Rh` and `8−` in `104Rh`, are interpreted as compatible with perpendicular semiclassical coupling for the assigned configurations. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.3 | true |
| SU08-11 | The decrease of `B(M1)` is not uniquely interpreted: cited PRM results connect it with evolving valence-particle angles, while a shape change and particle-shape coupling remain alternatives. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.3 | true |
| SU08-12 | Near-constant `S(I)` and energy degeneracy below `400 keV` in `103Rh` are cited as candidate fingerprints, with core structure inferred to influence isotopic degeneracy strongly. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.2; Fig.1 | true |
| SU08-13 | The measurements cover one member of each proposed doublet, not both partners; the authors call partner-band and higher-spin lifetimes absolutely necessary. | evidence-boundary | direct | PDF pp.3-4; Tables I-III; Summary | true |
| SU08-14 | Similar partner-band `B(M1)`/`B(E2)` behavior, or convergence at high spin together with energy degeneracy, is proposed as support; failure of both outcomes would indicate nonchiral bands. | author-proposed-test | direct | PDF p.4 | true |
| SU08-15 | Consequently, this paper strengthens the lifetime baseline but does not itself verify the identical-electromagnetic-properties criterion for either doublet. | analytical-inference | direct | SU08-6, SU08-13/14 | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

| Nucleus | Candidate configuration | Measured member | Evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `103Rh` | `πg9/2^-1⊗ν(h11/2)^2`, bandhead `23/2+` | Band 3 candidate states; absolute values reported at `25/2+–29/2+` | partner-band lifetimes absent |
| `104Rh` | `πg9/2^-1⊗νh11/2`, bandhead `8−` | one candidate sequence; absolute values reported at `9−–13−` | partner-band lifetimes absent |

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- Absolute transition strengths for one band cannot establish equality of two partner bands.
- `B(M1)` values depend on the pure-M1 assumption; mixing ratios are not measured here.
- Energies and branching ratios come from earlier experiments and are not independently redetermined in this RDDS paper.
- The cause of decreasing `B(M1)` and `B(E2)` staggering is unresolved; angular-momentum recoupling and shape evolution remain possible.
- The comparison between `103Rh` and `104Rh` is an isotopic/systematic comparison, not a substitute for within-nucleus partner-band symmetry.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | Audit item | Agent judgment | Evidence / locator | review_status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The durable result is an absolute-strength baseline and a localization of ratio staggering in `B(E2)`, not confirmation of chirality. | SU08-6, SU08-8, SU08-13 | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | Assumptions | Pure-M1 transitions and imported branching ratios enter the strength extraction; the band configurations are prior/model-supported assignments. | PDF pp.1,3 | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Transfer conditions | The inverse-kinematics degrader/DDCM design is transferable to short-lived high-spin states, but its velocity, foil and distance parameters are experiment-specific. | SU08-1 to SU08-3 | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Failure condition | If partner-band strengths remain different and do not converge where energies approach, the paper's stated test classifies the pair as nonchiral. | SU08-14 | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Reverse test | Measure higher-spin and partner-band lifetimes with mixing ratios, then compare both bands' in-band and interband matrix elements using the same model. | PDF p.4 | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research decision | Retain both pairs as candidates with a one-sided lifetime constraint; never label the paper as an electromagnetic equality test already passed. | Full paper | unreviewed |

### Companion Evidence Audit

- Candidate-band energy/`S(I)` fingerprints: `observed/derived from earlier schemes`.
- One-member lifetimes and absolute strengths: `observed/derived in this experiment`.
- Partner-band equality: `not measured`.
- Perpendicular/aplanar geometry: `model/systematics interpretation, not directly observed`.
- Origin of `B(E2)` staggering: `not understood` in the source.

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Effect: `supports` a lifetime-constrained candidate baseline, `limits` claims based on ratio staggering, and `requires` partner-band measurements.
- Persistence: create source, experiment, two nuclei and two candidate-pair pages; extend the RDDS method page and the chirality evidence map.
- Review state: all `SU08-*` and AR claims remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence gate.

## Human Review Triage

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **SU08-6/13/15 — one-sided lifetime scope.** Confirm that no wording implies both partner bands were measured.
- **SU08-7 — strength-extraction assumptions.** Preserve pure-M1 and imported-branching dependencies.
- **SU08-8/9 — staggering origin.** Keep the source's `B(E2)` attribution distinct from the A≈130 `B(M1)` comparison.
- **SU08-10/11 — geometry versus alternatives.** Treat perpendicular coupling as interpretation and preserve shape change as an alternative.

### P2/P3

- P2: verify earlier-paper band-number crosswalks before assigning a stable label to the unmeasured partners.
- P3: review navigation and notation before finalization.
