# Evidence for Chiral Symmetry Breaking in `136Pm` and `138Eu`

## Bibliographic Record

Physical Review C 63, 051302(R) (2001), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevC.63.051302`. The four-page Rapid Communication and the protected BibTeX export uniquely match `hecht_2001_Evidencechiral`.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: complete main text, both experimental data sets, Fig. 1 partial level schemes, Fig. 2 spectrum/polarization asymmetry, Fig. 3 experimental `B(M1)/B(E2)` systematics, Table I 3D TAC results, conclusions and cited model boundaries.
- Not covered: raw coincidence cubes, event-level polarization calibration, the preliminary `136Pm` report and earlier `138Eu` spectroscopy cited by the paper, or the Starosta 2001 isotone paper used for bandhead-spin systematics.
- Coverage caveats: no supplementary material is identified. Several spins in Fig. 1 are parenthesized/tentative; bandhead spins are assigned from Ref. 6 systematics rather than independently fixed in this paper.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

- The authors ask whether the recently predicted left-/right-handed aplanar geometry in odd-odd triaxial nuclei has experimental counterparts across the `N=75` isotones, using same-parity `ΔI=1` partner bands as its expected finite-spin signature (PDF p. 1 / journal p. 051302-1).
- They target new partner structures in `136Pm` and `138Eu`, where TRS calculations for the low-lying `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` configuration indicate appreciable triaxiality and the valence-particle/core angular momenta can form an aplanar triad (PDF p. 1 / journal p. 051302-1).

## Method and Design Logic

- Independent fusion-evaporation experiments populate `136Pm` and `138Eu`. γ-γ doubles/triples establish the new `ΔI=1` sequences and their links to known yrast bands (PDF pp. 1-2 / journal pp. 051302-1–2; Fig. 1).
- DCO ratios constrain relative spins and transition multipolarities in both nuclei; YRAST Ball clover polarization in `136Pm` additionally tests electric versus magnetic character for selected in-band and interband `ΔI=1` transitions (PDF pp. 2-3 / journal pp. 051302-2–3; Fig. 2).
- Transition energies, alignments and branching-derived in-band `B(M1;I→I-1)/B(E2;I→I-2)` ratios are compared between each new and yrast band. Their similarity motivates a common configuration assignment, while TRS-fed 3D TAC calculations test whether an aplanar solution gives the observed ratio scale and spin trend (PDF pp. 3-4 / journal pp. 051302-3–4; Fig. 3; Table I).

## Key Evidence and Reasoning Chain

- Coincidence placement + `ΔI=1`/`ΔI=2` multipolarity constraints + observed interband links → a new partner sequence next to the known yrast band in each nucleus (Fig. 1; PDF pp. 2-3).
- Similar transition energies, alignment and in-band `B(M1)/B(E2)` → author assignment of the new bands to the same `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` configuration as the yrast bands (PDF p. 3; Fig. 3).
- Roughly `300 keV` partner-band displacement + common assigned configuration + calculated aplanar TAC solutions → author proposal of chiral-twin candidates, with finite left/right tunnelling invoked to explain the nonzero splitting (PDF pp. 3-4; Table I).
- Diminishing calculated tilt angle `φ` at higher rotational frequency → model-predicted return to principal-axis rotation and termination of the chiral regime, rather than indefinite chirality at all spins (PDF p. 4; Table I).

## Summary

The paper reports new positive-parity `ΔI=1` bands in `136Pm` and `138Eu`, assigns them the same `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` configuration as the respective yrast bands, and offers the two pairs as chiral-twin candidates. It is direct experimental/model candidate evidence, but the conclusion does not claim a model-independent observation of broken chirality: configuration and aplanar geometry remain inferred, the partners stay about `300 keV` apart, and 3D TAC cannot calculate their quantum mixing.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- `136Pm`: `116Sn(24Mg,p3n)136Pm` at `130` and `135 MeV`; two stacked `116Sn` foils, each `0.8 mg/cm²`; Yale ESTU Tandem and YRAST Ball with 18 coaxial Ge, three LEPS and four clover detectors; about `6.7×10^8` γ-γ coincidences in five days (PDF p. 1 / journal p. 051302-1).
- `138Eu`: `106Cd(35Cl,2pn)138Eu` at `150 MeV`; Daresbury Tandem and Eurogam Phase I with 45 large-volume Ge detectors; about `5.7×10^8` unfolded γ-γ coincidences (PDF pp. 1-2 / journal pp. 051302-1–2).
- 3D TAC: constant deformation/pairing parameters taken from TRS at `ℏω≈0.25 MeV`; `136Pm` uses `(ε2,ε4,γ)=(0.194,0.028,-25°)` and `138Eu` `(0.202,0.032,-24°)` (PDF p. 2 / journal p. 051302-2; Table I).

## Nuclear Structure Information

| Nucleus | Observed pair | Experimental relation | Paper interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `136Pm` | known positive-parity yrast band plus new `ΔI=1` band, with the new sequence shown approximately over `11+–15+` in Fig. 1 | mixed-dipole in-band transitions, E2 crossovers and multiple interband links; selected magnetic character checked with clover asymmetry | common `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` configuration and chiral-twin candidate |
| `138Eu` | known positive-parity yrast band plus new `ΔI=1` band, with the new sequence shown approximately over `11+–17+` in Fig. 1 | mixed-dipole in-band transitions, E2 crossovers, multiple links and a double-gated spectrum | common `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` configuration and chiral-twin candidate |

Parenthesized spins in Fig. 1 remain tentative. The pair labels above are stable page identities for this source and do not imply that later literature must preserve every level assignment unchanged.

## Authors' Interpretation

The authors interpret the two pairs within the particle-hole/core triaxial geometry proposed for `N=75` odd-odd nuclei. They reject simple exact degeneracy as a requirement at all spins, attribute the observed `≈300 keV` separation to left/right tunnelling, and use 3D TAC to support an aplanar interval followed by return to principal-axis rotation. Their calibrated endpoint is “good candidates,” despite the stronger wording in the paper title.

## Model Results

- TRS supplies fixed deformations at one reference frequency; the cited TRS result is attributed to a private communication and is not an experimental shape measurement.
- Table I gives `θ`, `φ`, spin and calculated `B(M1)/B(E2)` versus rotational frequency. For `136Pm`, the aplanar solution persists longer in the table than for `138Eu`; both trend toward `φ=0°` at their upper-frequency end.
- The solid curves in Fig. 3 reproduce the broad decrease in the ratios, but the calculation represents one intrinsic aplanar solution and cannot generate the observed quantum doublet splitting/mixing.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- The authors discuss unfavoured signature, quasiparticle and γ-vibrational alternatives mainly through excitation-energy systematics; they do not calculate all alternatives against the same transition data.
- Common configuration is inferred from energy/alignment/ratio similarity, not measured by a configuration-specific observable such as a `g` factor.
- No lifetimes or absolute `B(M1)`/`B(E2)` values are reported; Fig. 3 uses ratios derived from observed decay branches.
- Bandhead spins depend on the Starosta 2001 systematics. Several Fig. 1 assignments are tentative, and the paper provides partial rather than complete level schemes.
- Near-degenerate same-parity bands plus an aplanar mean-field solution do not constitute a model-independent selection rule for chirality. Later chiral-vibration, tunnelling and configuration-mixing analyses must be compared explicitly.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | 审核项 | Agent 判断 | Evidence / locator | 审核状态 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | This is the first direct chiral-candidate experiment in the rolling corpus: it combines linked same-parity bands, electromagnetic assignments and aplanar TAC support. The source supports a candidate interpretation, not proof of spontaneous chiral-symmetry breaking. | HE01-2 to HE01-13; especially Summary on PDF p. 4 | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | Assumptions and dependencies | The chain depends on Ref. 6 bandhead systematics, common-configuration inference, TRS deformations/pairing fixed near one frequency, branching-derived ratios and comparison of a mixed quantum doublet to an unmixed TAC solution. | HE01-4, HE01-6, HE01-10/11; Table I | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Transfer conditions | DCO/polarization plus interband links are reusable evidence classes, but the numerical asymmetry calibration and inferred spin/configuration cannot be transferred to another array or nucleus without its own calibration and level scheme. | PDF pp. 2-3; Fig. 2 | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Failure conditions | If later lifetime/mixing-ratio/configuration-sensitive data show different intrinsic structures, or a quantum model reproduces the same observables as a vibration/signature/mixed configuration, the present fingerprint set no longer uniquely supports chirality. | Missing observables and alternatives listed on PDF pp. 3-4 | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Reverse/falsification test | Compare absolute in-band/interband matrix elements, measured mixing ratios and common-configuration observables with a quantum model that treats left/right tunnelling and competing γ vibration/signature structures on the same footing. | HE01-8 to HE01-11 plus source omissions | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research-question decision | Persist the two pair identities and project-level evidence row, then use Starosta 2001 to test whether the five-isotone systematics actually strengthen the chiral interpretation or mainly restate common fingerprints. | Full paper; Ref. 6 dependency | unreviewed |

### Companion Evidence Audit

- New bands and their in-band cascades: `observed` in Fig. 1; the `138Eu` band is also visible in the double-gated Fig. 2(a) spectrum.
- Interband links required to relate each pair: `observed` in the partial level schemes, though several weak branches lack individual quantitative discussion.
- `136Pm` magnetic character: `observed` only as calibration-consistent asymmetry for the 364/595/684-keV transitions; the uncertainties are large and do not establish all band transitions individually.
- Common intrinsic configuration and left/right handedness: `expected-but-not-established`; inferred from systematics and TAC rather than directly observed.
- Raw-event re-evaluation of weak links, DCO and asymmetry: `blocked-needs-raw/event-level data`.

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Existing Wiki understanding: chiral candidates require linked partner structures, electromagnetic evidence and an explicit aplanar model, while energy similarity alone is insufficient.
- Effect of this source: `supports` and `limits`.
- Reason: it supplies early direct experimental candidate evidence in two isotones and a 3D TAC comparison, but exposes dependence on tentative spins, inferred configuration, branching ratios and a model that cannot treat doublet mixing.
- Persistence decision: create source, nucleus, experiment and stable candidate-pair pages; add two candidate-evidence claims to the nuclear-chirality project. Defer synthesis/overview until the N=75 core-paper batch including Starosta 2001 is complete.
- Review state: all HE01 claims and analytical reconstruction remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence pool.

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **HE01-7/HE01-13 and AR-1 — title versus candidate-level conclusion.** Grounded evidence: the title says “symmetry breaking,” while the Summary calls the structures “good candidates.” Agent inference: project wording must stay at candidate strength. User check: verify this calibrated historical role. Risk: converting an early fingerprint paper into a model-independent discovery claim.
- **HE01-4/HE01-6 and AR-2 — spin/configuration dependency.** Grounded evidence: bandhead spins are imported from Ref. 6 systematics and the common `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` assignment follows energy/alignment/ratio similarity. Agent inference: spin and configuration layers are not equivalent to direct measurement. User check: confirm the two dependencies remain explicit. Risk: circular isotone systematics or overconfident band identity.
- **HE01-9 to HE01-12 — tunnelling and 3D TAC boundary.** Grounded evidence: Table I/Fig. 3 use fixed TRS inputs; the paper states TAC cannot account for mixing and therefore compares the calculation with average ratios. Agent inference: aplanar support and partner splitting are joined by an interpretation, not one self-contained quantum calculation. User check: preserve model-result versus author-interpretation layers. Risk: overstating agreement as a calculation of the observed doublet.

### P2/P3

- P2: verify the approximate Fig. 1 spin ranges, selected 136Pm asymmetry values and two experiment metadata blocks.
- P3: review page aliases, candidate-pair navigation, index/project placement and rolling-WIP status synchronization.
