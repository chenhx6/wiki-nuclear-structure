# The wobbling mode in `167Lu`

## Bibliographic Record

Physics Letters B 553, 197-203 (2003), DOI `10.1016/S0370-2693(02)03199-4`; PDF/BibTeX identity checked.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`
- Covered scope: experiment, TSD1/TSD2 links, SpeeDCO/angular-distribution mixing ratios, relative strengths, alternatives and PRM comparison.
- Not covered: forthcoming ND-structure analysis and independent UC/PRM reproduction.
- Coverage caveats: no usable polarization for the links; large-`abs(δ)` branch is selected by analogy/model consistency.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

- Author-explicit motivation: test whether the newly connected TSD2 band in `167Lu` is the wobbling excitation of TSD1 and whether the Lu-isotope interpretation survives a different experiment and nucleus (PDF pp.197-199).

## Method and Design Logic

- Establish TSD1/TSD2 links and rotational similarity; use SpeeDCO/angular distributions to obtain δ branches; convert the adopted branch and branching ratios to relative E2/M1 strengths; compare signature and three-quasiparticle alternatives with UC/PRM expectations (PDF pp.199-203, Table 1, Fig.6).

## Key Evidence and Reasoning Chain

- Connected ΔI=1 links → common decay topology; mixed-multipole fits → two δ branches; analogy with electric `163Lu` links selects the large branch → 92-98% E2; relative strengths and band systematics → author wobbling assignment (PDF pp.199-203).

## Summary

The paper gives evidence for TSD2 as one-phonon wobbling in `167Lu`, based on large inferred E2 components and relative strengths. Unlike `163Lu`, polarization did not independently select the branch.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

`123Sb(48Ca,4n)167Lu` at 203 MeV with the LBNL 88-Inch Cyclotron and 100-detector Gammasphere; TSD1/TSD2 populations about 8%/2% of yrast.

## Key Results

| ID | 陈述 | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AM03-1 | TSD1 and TSD2 were firmly assigned to `167Lu` and connected by several `ΔI=1` transitions. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.199-202, Figs.2 and 5 | true |
| AM03-2 | SpeeDCO/angular-distribution analysis gives small and large negative `δ` solutions; polarization was unavailable. | experimental-criterion | direct | PDF pp.200-201 | true |
| AM03-3 | Authors reject the small branches by analogy with electric links in `163Lu`; adopted links contain about `92-98%` E2. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.201, Table 1 | true |
| AM03-4 | Derived `B(E2)_out/B(E2)_in` values are much larger than cranking-like expectations and agree with PRM wobbling estimates. | model-result | direct | PDF pp.201-202, Fig.6 | true |
| AM03-5 | Signature-partner and three-quasiparticle alternatives are rejected using excitation energy, alignment and predicted weak links. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.202 | true |
| AM03-6 | Authors assign TSD2 as one-phonon wobbling built on TSD1. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.202-203 | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

- TSD1 and TSD2 are assigned to the same `167Lu` TSD family, with populations near 8% and 2% of yrast and several interband ΔI=1 links. The assignment-critical information is the branch-dependent E2 content rather than a complete duplicated level scheme.

## Authors' Interpretation

The authors interpret TSD2 as one-phonon wobbling and reject signature-partner/three-quasiparticle alternatives. The E2 dominance is inferred through an adopted branch, not directly fixed by polarization.

## Model Results

UC calculations constrain alternative configurations; PRM calculations reproduce the adopted relative-strength pattern. Both comparisons depend on selected deformation/moments of inertia and on the large-|δ| solution.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

The decisive E2 dominance is not directly fixed by polarization. Relative strengths depend on adopted branch; UC/PRM exclusions are model-conditioned.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | 审核项 | Agent 判断 | Evidence / locator | 审核状态 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AM03-AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The evidence is stronger than systematics alone but weaker than `163Lu` because the decisive large-E2 branch is selected without polarization. | Key Results and Competing Interpretations above | unreviewed |
| AM03-AR-2 | Assumptions and dependencies | The adopted band identities, mixing-ratio branches, configuration assignments, and model inputs are valid within the stated measured range. | Method/results/model sections cited above | unreviewed |
| AM03-AR-3 | Transfer conditions | Transfer only the measured observables and their explicit conditions; do not transfer the author interpretation without equivalent link and configuration evidence. | Source scope and claim locators above | unreviewed |
| AM03-AR-4 | Failure conditions | Alternative branch, band identity, configuration, or model dependence can weaken the structural label even when the measured transitions remain valid. | Competing Interpretations and Limitations above | unreviewed |
| AM03-AR-5 | Reverse/falsification test | Obtain independent lifetimes/multipolarities or common-input competing-model tests targeted to the stated evidence gap. | Follow-up observables identified by the source/Agent | unreviewed |
| AM03-AR-6 | Research-question decision | Retain the source in the project/synthesis evidence map with the source-local review boundary explicit. | Whole-source assessment | unreviewed |

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Existing Wiki understanding: The Wiki already contained the broader wobbling topic and related candidate map, but not this source in a complete source-local evidence and review structure.
- Effect of this source: supports
- Reason: The evidence is stronger than systematics alone but weaker than `163Lu` because the decisive large-E2 branch is selected without polarization.
- Persistence decision: project update / synthesis update
- Review state: page-level `human-reviewed`; Key Results claims remain `needs_review: true` for future claim-specific paper use.

## Human Review Triage

Review disposition: the user completed a rough page-level review on 2026-07-25 and accepted the current evidence-calibrated wording without correction. The P0/P1 items below are retained as future strict paper-use verification prompts, not unresolved ingest blockers.

### P0

- `AM03-2`/`AM03-3`, Table 1 — Evidence: no usable polarization; large negative δ branches are chosen by analogy with `163Lu`, producing 92-98% E2. Agent inference: branch selection and PRM agreement are not independent. User check: both δ solutions, adopted branch, and recalculated strengths. Risk: a small branch removes the electromagnetic basis of the assignment.

### P1

- `AM03-4`/`AM03-5` — Review how strongly UC/PRM exclusions depend on selected deformation, configuration and branch assumptions.

### P2/P3

- P2: BibTeX author-field mismatch is metadata-only. P3: navigation.

## Human Review Record

- 2026-07-25: the user completed a rough review of this source page and accepted its current claims, attribution boundaries, locators and stated limitations without requesting corrections.

## Review Status

Page-level review is complete for this ingest round. Claim-level `needs_review` and Analytical Reconstruction review markers remain unchanged because this was a rough review rather than exhaustive claim-by-claim paper certification.
