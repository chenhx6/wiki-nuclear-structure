# Evidence for Chiral Wobbler in Nuclei

## Bibliographic Record

PRL 132, 092501 (2024), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.092501`; PDF/BibTeX identity checked.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `read`
- Covered scope: complete main PRL, level scheme, ADO/polarization, mixing-ratio logic, DSAM lifetimes, absolute transition-probability figures and PRM interpretation.
- Not covered: Supplemental Material numerical transition table referenced as Ref.61 was not present in the supplied raw PDF.
- Coverage caveats: exact per-transition numerical values beyond the main figures require the supplement before paper-level use.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

- Author-explicit motivation: test whether chirality and wobbling can coexist in bands assigned the same odd-odd configuration, forming a “chiral wobbler” (PDF pp.1-2).

## Method and Design Logic

- Combine three-band spectroscopy, ADO/polarization, DSAM lifetimes and absolute strengths; compare B1/B2 chiral fingerprints and B1/B3 wobbling fingerprints with PRM angular-momentum geometry (PDF pp.2-5, Figs.1-7, Table I).

## Key Evidence and Reasoning Chain

- Similar B1/B2 energies/strengths plus M1 interlinks → chiral-partner interpretation; increasingly E2 B1-B3 links → wobbling interpretation; same-configuration assignment and PRM mapping → coexistence claim. Missing supplemental numbers limit audit.

## Summary

The paper proposes `74Br` bands B1/B2 as chiral partners and B3 as a one-phonon wobbling excitation built on B1, coining an experimental “chiral wobbler” candidate. The conclusion is evidence/interpretation supported by multiple observables and PRM, not a model-independent proof of coexistence.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

`58Ni(19F,2p1n)74Br`; AFRODITE with eight Compton-suppressed clovers (five at 90°, three at 135°), about `3.5×10^9` γ-γ events. A thick backed target stopped recoils for DSAM lifetime extraction with modified LINESHAPE and five-step side feeding.

## Key Results

| ID | 陈述 | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GU24-1 | Three `ΔI=1` bands assigned the same `πg9/2⊗νg9/2` configuration were extended and interconnected. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.2-3, Figs.1-2 | true |
| GU24-2 | Spin/parity and E2/M1 mixing were constrained by ADO ratios and linear polarization. | experimental-criterion | direct | PDF pp.2-3, Fig.3; supplement required for full table | true |
| GU24-3 | Level lifetimes were measured by DSAM and agree with earlier measurements within uncertainties. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.2-4, Fig.4, Table I | true |
| GU24-4 | B1/B2 satisfy the authors' chiral-doublet fingerprint set, including similar energies/staggering/alignment/in-band strengths and M1-dominated interband links. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.3-4, Figs.5-6 | true |
| GU24-5 | B1-B3 E2 fractions rise with spin and reach about 90% at high spin; B3 is interpreted as one-phonon wobbling. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.4, Fig.6; supplement for numbers | true |
| GU24-6 | PRM angular-momentum components support chiral B1/B2 and wobbling B1/B3 pictures. | model-result | direct | PDF pp.4-5, Figs.6-7 | true |
| GU24-7 | Authors conclude evidence for coexistence of chirality and wobbling with the same configuration, notated as a chiral wobbler. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.5, Summary | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

B1/B2/B3 are interconnected ΔI=1 bands assigned πg9/2⊗νg9/2. Lifetimes and relative/absolute strengths provide unusually broad observables, but exact transition tables are incomplete without the supplement.

## Authors' Interpretation

The authors conclude evidence for a same-configuration coexistence of chirality and wobbling, not a model-independent proof.

## Model Results

PRM angular-momentum components reproduce the proposed chiral and wobbling geometries. The mapping depends on common configuration and fitted deformation/coupling assumptions.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

The same-configuration inference uses linking patterns, similar strengths and PRM. Chiral/wobbling fingerprints are not individually sufficient; the missing supplement prevents a full numeric audit. Future thin-target and `g`-factor measurements are explicitly proposed.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | 审核项 | Agent 判断 | Evidence / locator | 审核状态 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GU24-AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The three-band comparison, lifetimes and strengths are unusually rich, but same-configuration coexistence still depends on the missing supplement and PRM mapping. | Key Results and Competing Interpretations above | unreviewed |
| GU24-AR-2 | Assumptions and dependencies | The adopted band identities, mixing-ratio branches, configuration assignments, and model inputs are valid within the stated measured range. | Method/results/model sections cited above | unreviewed |
| GU24-AR-3 | Transfer conditions | Transfer only the measured observables and their explicit conditions; do not transfer the author interpretation without equivalent link and configuration evidence. | Source scope and claim locators above | unreviewed |
| GU24-AR-4 | Failure conditions | Alternative branch, band identity, configuration, or model dependence can weaken the structural label even when the measured transitions remain valid. | Competing Interpretations and Limitations above | unreviewed |
| GU24-AR-5 | Reverse/falsification test | Obtain independent lifetimes/multipolarities or common-input competing-model tests targeted to the stated evidence gap. | Follow-up observables identified by the source/Agent | unreviewed |
| GU24-AR-6 | Research-question decision | Retain the source in the project/synthesis evidence map with the source-local review boundary explicit. | Whole-source assessment | unreviewed |

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Existing Wiki understanding: The Wiki already contained the broader wobbling topic and related candidate map, but not this source in a complete source-local evidence and review structure.
- Effect of this source: supports
- Reason: The three-band comparison, lifetimes and strengths are unusually rich, but same-configuration coexistence still depends on the missing supplement and PRM mapping.
- Persistence decision: project update / synthesis update
- Review state: page-level `human-reviewed` within the main-paper-only scope; Key Results claims remain `needs_review: true` for future claim-specific paper use.

## Human Review Triage

Review disposition: the user completed a rough page-level review on 2026-07-25 and accepted the current main-paper evidence boundary without correction. The P0/P1 items below are retained as future strict paper-use verification prompts, not unresolved ingest blockers; the missing Supplemental Material remains an explicit coverage limitation.

### P0

- `GU24-2`/`GU24-5`, Fig.3/Fig.6 — Evidence: main text gives trends, but the per-transition ADO/polarization/mixing table is in missing Supplemental Material. Agent inference: exact E2 fractions cannot be paper-level audited. User check: obtain supplement and verify each value. Risk: unresolved numbers may be quoted as verified.

### P1

- `GU24-1`/`GU24-4`/`GU24-7`, Figs.5-7 — Evidence: linking/strength similarities and PRM support same configuration and dual chiral/wobbling mapping. Agent inference: coexistence depends on configuration identity and model geometry. User check: configuration evidence and PRM parameter mapping. Risk: fingerprint conjunction may be overstated as model-independent proof.
- `GU24-3`, Fig.4/Table I — Review DSAM side-feeding assumptions and lifetime uncertainties before using absolute strengths quantitatively.

### P2/P3

- P2: exact level/transition transcription after the supplement is obtained. P3: metadata/navigation.

## Human Review Record

- 2026-07-25: the user completed a rough review of this source page and accepted its current main-paper claims, attribution boundaries, locators and explicit missing-supplement limitation without requesting corrections.

## Review Status

Page-level review is complete for this ingest round. `reading_depth: read`, claim-level `needs_review` and Analytical Reconstruction review markers remain unchanged because the Supplemental Material was unavailable and this was not exhaustive claim-by-claim paper certification.

## Extracted Pages

- Nuclei: [[74br]]
- Concepts: [[nuclear-chirality]], [[wobbling-motion]]
- Methods: [[angular-distribution]], [[linear-polarization-asymmetry]]
