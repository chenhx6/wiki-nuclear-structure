# Multiphonon transverse wobbling in `133Ba`

## Bibliographic Record

Physics Letters B 823, 136756 (2021), DOI `10.1016/j.physletb.2021.136756`; PDF/BibTeX identity checked.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`
- Covered scope: full article, bands 1-4, new links, DCO/polarization, mixing ratios, transition ratios and QTR/FA comparison.
- Not covered: detailed setup paper cited as Ref.39 and independent QTR reproduction.
- Coverage caveats: low-energy 146.3/219.2-keV links could not be characterized; some in-band E2 assignments are assumed from band structure.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

- Author-explicit motivation: identify multiphonon transverse wobbling associated with a hole-like quasiparticle in `133Ba` (PDF pp.1-2).

## Method and Design Logic

- Extend bands and links, use DCO/polarization contour fits where statistics permit, calculate E_wob and relative ratios, and compare a frozen-alignment QTR description with the proposed n_w ladder (PDF pp.2-6, Figs.1-4, Tables 1-2).

## Key Evidence and Reasoning Chain

- Electric/E2-dominated measured links → adjacent-band wobbling evidence; decreasing E_wob → transverse classification; QTR agreement → hole-like n_w=0/1/2 interpretation; unmeasured low-energy links leave the ladder incomplete.

## Summary

The paper reports `n_ω=0,1,2` transverse wobbling and calls it the first hole-like quasiparticle TW case. The adjacent-band links with sufficient statistics are predominantly electric/E2, but the full decay network is not uniformly measured.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

`124Sn(13C,4n)133Ba` at 48 MeV using the TIFR 14-UD Pelletron; 11 Compton-suppressed INGA clovers at 157°, 140°, 115° and 90°.

## Nuclear Structure Information

Bands 1/2/3 are proposed as n_w=0/1/2 and band 4 as signature partner. The 146.3- and 219.2-keV links lack measured multipolarities.

## Authors' Interpretation

The authors report first hole-like multiphonon transverse wobbling; the source does not claim uniform electromagnetic characterization of every ladder link.

## Model Results

Frozen-alignment QTR reproduces selected energies/ratios using chosen MoI values. Its alignment and rigidity assumptions define the interpretation boundary.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

The band hierarchy combines measured and assumed multipolarities. Missing low-energy link characterization weakens a fully closed phonon ladder; frozen alignment and selected MoI values remain model assumptions.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | 审核项 | Agent 判断 | Evidence / locator | 审核状态 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RD21-AR-1 | Core reconstruction | Several adjacent links are measured, but uncharacterized low-energy links prevent a uniformly closed multiphonon ladder. | Key Results and Competing Interpretations above | unreviewed |
| RD21-AR-2 | Assumptions and dependencies | The adopted band identities, mixing-ratio branches, configuration assignments, and model inputs are valid within the stated measured range. | Method/results/model sections cited above | unreviewed |
| RD21-AR-3 | Transfer conditions | Transfer only the measured observables and their explicit conditions; do not transfer the author interpretation without equivalent link and configuration evidence. | Source scope and claim locators above | unreviewed |
| RD21-AR-4 | Failure conditions | Alternative branch, band identity, configuration, or model dependence can weaken the structural label even when the measured transitions remain valid. | Competing Interpretations and Limitations above | unreviewed |
| RD21-AR-5 | Reverse/falsification test | Obtain independent lifetimes/multipolarities or common-input competing-model tests targeted to the stated evidence gap. | Follow-up observables identified by the source/Agent | unreviewed |
| RD21-AR-6 | Research-question decision | Retain the source in the project/synthesis evidence map with the source-local review boundary explicit. | Whole-source assessment | unreviewed |

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Existing Wiki understanding: The Wiki already contained the broader wobbling topic and related candidate map, but not this source in a complete source-local evidence and review structure.
- Effect of this source: supports
- Reason: Several adjacent links are measured, but uncharacterized low-energy links prevent a uniformly closed multiphonon ladder.
- Persistence decision: project update / synthesis update
- Review state: page-level `human-reviewed`; Key Results claims remain `needs_review: true` for future claim-specific paper use.

## Human Review Triage

Review disposition: the user completed a rough page-level review on 2026-07-25 and accepted the current evidence-calibrated wording without correction. The P0/P1 items below are retained as future strict paper-use verification prompts, not unresolved ingest blockers.

### P0

- P0: none identified.

### P1

- `RD21-2`/`RD21-3`, Tables 1-2 — Evidence: several links are electric/E2, but 146.3 and 219.2 keV lack multipolarity measurements. Agent inference: the phonon ladder is not electromagnetically complete. User check: which ladder steps are measured versus assumed and whether the n_w=2 assignment survives. Risk: uniform certainty would overstate incomplete coverage.

### P2/P3

- P2: in-band E2 assumptions and selected MoI values. P3: navigation.

## Human Review Record

- 2026-07-25: the user completed a rough review of this source page and accepted its current claims, attribution boundaries, locators and stated limitations without requesting corrections.

## Review Status

Page-level review is complete for this ingest round. Claim-level `needs_review` and Analytical Reconstruction review markers remain unchanged because this was a rough review rather than exhaustive claim-by-claim paper certification.

## Extracted Pages
