# Evidence for Pseudospin-Chiral Quartet Bands in the Presence of Octupole Correlations

## Bibliographic Record

Physics Letters B 807, 135572 (2020), DOI `10.1016/j.physletb.2020.135572`. The protected BibTeX key is `guo_2020_Evidencepseudospinchiral`.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: all six pages; experiment and partial level scheme; coincidence, `R_ac` and angular-distribution constraints; positive-parity D3-D6 quartet; negative-parity D7/D8 pair; alignments, `S(I)` and branching-derived ratios; E1 links; TAC-CDFT deformation input and RAT-PRM comparison.
- Not covered: Ref.27's full channel-selection/analysis details, unpublished Ref.35, or the promised Ref.41 azimuthal plots, angular-momentum components and full RAT-PRM discussion.
- Coverage caveat: several weak in-band mixing ratios are assumed rather than measured; no lifetimes or absolute reduced probabilities are reported.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

The paper asks whether one odd-A nucleus can show a same-parity four-band manifold shaped jointly by pseudospin and chiral symmetries, while a directly E1-linked opposite-parity chiral system exposes octupole correlations without an intermediary nonchiral band.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- `122Sn(13C,4n)131Ba`, `65 MeV`, LNL Tandem; two self-supporting `122Sn` foils, each `0.5 mg/cm²`.
- GALILEO: 25 Compton-suppressed Ge detectors at `90°`, `119°`, `129°` and `152°`; approximately `1.2×10^9` triple-or-higher events.
- Two-point `R_ac=Iγ(152°)/Iγ(90°)` calibration: approximately `1.5` for stretched quadrupole and `0.8` for stretched dipole; Fig.3 calculations adopt `σ/I=0.24`.
- Four-angle angular distributions determine mixing ratios for most in-band M1/E2 transitions.
- RAT-PRM uses TAC-CDFT `β2=0.22`, `γ=27.1°` for the `πh11/2g7/2⊗νh11/2` reference and tentatively adopts `β3=0.05`.

## Summary

The experiment newly establishes D4 and D8 and significantly extends D3 and D5-D7. D3-D6 form a positive-parity, mutually linked four-band manifold interpreted through mixed `πh11/2(g7/2,d5/2)⊗νh11/2` configurations as the first pseudospin-chiral quartet candidate. D7/D8 form a negative-parity chiral-doublet candidate assigned `π(h11/2)^2⊗νh11/2`. Many D7-to-D3-D6 E1 links support octupole correlations between the two systems. RAT-PRM reproduces much of the energy/ratio systematics but underpredicts feeding to D5, and the promised angular-momentum geometry is not contained in this paper.

## Key Results

| ID | Statement | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GU20-1 | The data set contains about `1.2×10^9` triple-or-higher GALILEO events from `122Sn(13C,4n)` at `65 MeV`. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p.2, Sec.2 | true |
| GU20-2 | D4 and D8 are newly established, while D3 and D5-D7 are significantly extended in the partial `131Ba` scheme. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.2-3; Figs.1-2 | true |
| GU20-3 | `R_ac` and four-angle angular distributions constrain transition character; 549-keV D6→D3 and 715/721-keV D8→D7 links are M1/E2, supporting same parity within each linked group. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.2-3; Fig.3 | true |
| GU20-4 | Four positive-parity D3-D6 bands are interconnected by many M1/E2 and some weak E2 transitions; energy ordering of D4-D6 changes with spin and links connect every pair. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.2-4; Figs.1,4 | true |
| GU20-5 | The paper assigns all four positive bands to the `πh11/2(g7/2,d5/2)⊗νh11/2` family using parity, signature behavior, alignments near `8-10ℏ`, neighboring-nucleus systematics and exclusion of a low-Ω-neutron alternative. | configuration-assignment | indirect | PDF pp.3-4; Fig.4 | true |
| GU20-6 | An earlier D5/D6 interpretation as two signatures of the same `πh11/2g7/2⊗νh11/2` configuration is rejected because it predicts interband ΔI=1 strengths opposite to observation. | competing-interpretation | direct | PDF p.4, Sec.3.1 | true |
| GU20-7 | D3-D6 cannot be divided into two experimental pairs uniquely by energies or links; their pseudospin-chiral quartet interpretation treats pseudospin and chiral splittings as competing, comparable effects. | author-interpretation | direct | PDF pp.1,4, Abstract and Sec.3.1 | true |
| GU20-8 | Branching-derived `B(M1)/B(E2)` values are broadly similar for D3-D6, but several have large uncertainties; staggering appears above `29/2ℏ`, with D4/D5 opposite in phase to D3. | derived-observable | direct | PDF p.4; Fig.4 | true |
| GU20-9 | D7/D8 are proposed as a negative-parity chiral pair with `π(h11/2)^2⊗νh11/2`, based on energy, `S(I)`, ratio and alignment similarities to `133Ce/135Nd`. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.4; Fig.4 | true |
| GU20-10 | More than half of D7's intensity decays to D3-D6 through many E1 links, supporting octupole correlations between configurations differing by `πh11/2` versus `π(g7/2,d5/2)`. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.4-5; Figs.1,5 | true |
| GU20-11 | The measured same-initial-state relative E1 pattern supports a `πd5/2` component in all four positive bands, but RAT-PRM significantly underpredicts transitions feeding D5. | model-comparison | direct | PDF p.5; Fig.5 | true |
| GU20-12 | RAT-PRM gives dominant `πh11/2g7/2⊗νh11/2` components for D3/D4, stronger `πd5/2` mixing for D5/D6 and `π(h11/2)^2⊗νh11/2` for D7/D8. | model-result | indirect | PDF p.5, Sec.3.2 | true |
| GU20-13 | RAT-PRM broadly reproduces energies, D4/D5 crossing near `27/2ℏ`, `S(I)` and ratios, but transition amplitudes feeding D5 are sensitive to nearby mixed states and not reproduced. | model-discrepancy | direct | PDF p.5; Figs.4-5 | true |
| GU20-14 | `β3=0.05` is a tentative RAT-PRM input for octupole-correlation effects, not an experimental determination or evidence of stable octupole deformation. | model-assumption | direct | PDF p.5, Sec.3.2 | true |
| GU20-15 | The paper defers azimuthal plots, angular-momentum components and the detailed RAT-PRM geometry for all three proposed pairs to a future reference. | source-completeness-boundary | direct | PDF p.5, Sec.3.2; Ref.41 | true |
| GU20-16 | For a few weak in-band transitions the analysis assumes `δ=-0.2(1)`; no lifetimes or absolute reduced transition probabilities are measured. | evidence-boundary | direct | PDF p.4, Fig.4 caption; p.5, Summary | true |
| GU20-17 | A two-same-configuration-doublet alternative is excluded only within the calculated quasiparticle mapping, not by a direct configuration observable. | model-boundary | direct | PDF p.5, Sec.3.2 | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

| Structure | Experimental identity | Configuration/interpretation status |
|---|---|---|
| D3-D6 | four mutually linked positive-parity dipole bands; D4 new | mixed pseudospin `πh11/2(g7/2,d5/2)⊗νh11/2`; pseudospin-chiral quartet candidate |
| D7/D8 | negative-parity linked doublet; D8 new | RAT-PRM `π(h11/2)^2⊗νh11/2`; chiral-doublet candidate |
| D7→D3-D6 | many E1 links and relative E1 ratios | octupole-correlation evidence; not stable octupole deformation |

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- The experimental four-band manifold is secure, but its decomposition into two chiral pairs and two pseudospin sectors is not uniquely defined by energy or links.
- Common-configuration and pseudospin-component assignments rely on systematics, alignment exclusions and RAT-PRM wavefunctions.
- The key chiral angular-momentum geometry is deferred; energy/`S(I)`/ratio similarity remains nonunique.
- Branching-derived ratios depend on angular-distribution mixing ratios, including assumed values for weak lines, and lack lifetime normalization.
- E1 links support reflection-asymmetric correlations but do not determine a static `β3`; the model's `β3=0.05` is tentative.
- D5 is a visible model stress point in relative E1 feeding and state mixing.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | Audit item | Agent judgment | Evidence / locator | review_status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The durable experimental result is a six-band, two-parity linked manifold; “two positive chiral pairs plus one negative pair” is an experiment-model interpretation. | GU20-2 to GU20-10 | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | Quartet identifiability | D3-D6 should persist as one four-band object because the paper explicitly cannot pair them uniquely from energies/links. | GU20-4/7 | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Octupole scope | Direct E1 connectivity supports octupole correlations between the proposed systems, not stable reflection-asymmetric deformation. | GU20-10/11/14 | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Geometry gap | RAT-PRM agreement strengthens configuration consistency but cannot replace the missing azimuthal/angular-momentum demonstration. | GU20-12/13/15 | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Failure condition | Lifetimes or a geometry calculation that separates the four positive bands into a different coupling scheme would revise the pseudospin-chiral label while preserving the level scheme. | GU20-7/15/16 | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research decision | Create one positive quartet page and one negative doublet page; do not force D3-D6 into two stable pair identities. | Full paper | unreviewed |

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Effect: `supports` coupled pseudospin/chirality/octupole phenomenology in `131Ba` while `limits` model-independent pair counting and geometry claims.
- Persistence: source, positive-quartet and negative-doublet pages; on-touch update `131Ba`, GALILEO experiment, pseudospin/chiral and octupole concepts, project and index.
- Review state: all `GU20-*` and AR claims remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence gate.

## Human Review Triage

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **GU20-4/7 — four-band identity.** Do not impose two fixed positive pairs that the experimental ordering/links do not select.
- **GU20-5/12/17 — configuration logic.** Keep systematics/exclusion and RAT-PRM wavefunctions separate from direct observables.
- **GU20-10/11/14 — octupole language.** E1 correlations are not stable octupole deformation; `β3` is tentative input.
- **GU20-13/15 — model completeness.** Retain D5 mismatch and missing angular-momentum geometry.
- **GU20-16 — electromagnetic gap.** Carry assumed mixing ratios and absent lifetimes into any use of the ratios.
