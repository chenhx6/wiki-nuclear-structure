# Chen, Frauendorf and Petrache (2019): Transverse wobbling in an even-even nucleus

## Bibliographic Record

Q. B. Chen, S. Frauendorf and C. M. Petrache, *Physical Review C* **100**, 061301(R) (2019), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevC.100.061301`. The BibTeX key is uniquely matched as `chen_2019_Transversewobbling`.

## Scientific Question and Motivation

The paper asks whether transverse wobbling can be realized with two aligned quasiprotons in an even-even nucleus. The candidate is the pair of `130Ba` bands S1 and S1-prime, assigned to a pi(h11/2)^2 configuration in the preceding spectroscopy work. The authors combine constrained triaxial covariant density functional theory (CDFT) with particle-rotor model (PRM) calculations rather than presenting a new level-scheme measurement.

## Scope and Reading Depth

Full five-page Rapid Communication read. Covered: the motivation and prior experimental input, angular-distribution mixing-ratio ambiguity, constrained CDFT deformation, TAC checks, PRM energy and transition-probability calculations, angular-momentum probability distributions, higher-band phonon assignments and limitations. Not covered: an independent reanalysis of the `130Ba` gamma-ray data or lifetime measurements beyond the ratios quoted from the experimental source.

## Summary

The CDFT/TAC plus PRM calculation proposes a stable transverse-wobbling interpretation for two `130Ba` bands built on pi(h11/2)^2. It combines energy, mixing-ratio-derived strength ratios and angular-momentum geometry, while retaining the two-solution delta ambiguity.

## Method and Design Logic

The constrained CDFT calculation supplies a triaxial shape and pi(h11/2)^2 configuration. TAC explores deformation sensitivity, while the PRM uses spin-dependent moments of inertia adjusted to the observed zero- and one-phonon bands. The paper tests the candidate through wobbling-energy trend, interband mixing-ratio-derived B(M1)/B(E2) and B(E2)/B(E2) ratios, and the angular-momentum probability distributions for the n = 0 and n = 1 states.

## Key Results

| ID | Claim | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CH19-1 | The experimental input consists of two observed `130Ba` bands S1 and S1-prime, populated in the 122Sn(13C,5n) reaction at 65 MeV; their connecting Delta-I = 1 mixing ratios and transition-probability ratios were taken from prior angular-distribution work. | review-background / observed-fact-input | direct | PDF p. 1 and Table I | true |
| CH19-2 | The prior angular-distribution fits can produce two chi-squared solutions for a mixing ratio delta, one with absolute value below 1 and one above 1; the paper adopts the smaller solution because it has the lower chi-squared, while explicitly noting that the larger solution cannot be excluded from angular distributions alone. | method / experimental-criterion | direct | PDF p. 2, paragraph before Table I | true |
| CH19-3 | Constrained CDFT assigns the pi(h11/2)^2 configuration to S1/S1-prime and finds a triaxial minimum near beta = 0.24, gamma = 21.5 degrees, with an excited-shape energy comparable to the experimental band excitation; this is a model assignment and not a direct shape measurement. | model-calculation / author-interpretation | direct | PDF p. 2, CDFT and TAC paragraphs | true |
| CH19-4 | The PRM uses spin-dependent moments of inertia whose fitted short-to-medium ratio is larger than the irrotational-flow value; the authors associate this choice with stabilizing transverse wobbling and note microscopic-cranking and deformation-fluctuation caveats. | model-calculation / limitation | direct | PDF p. 2, PRM parameter paragraph | true |
| CH19-5 | The PRM reproduces the S1 and S1-prime energy sequences and gives a wobbling energy that decreases through the displayed spin interval, which the authors use as evidence supporting transverse wobbling. | model-calculation / author-interpretation | direct | PDF p. 2, Fig. 1(a)-(c) | true |
| CH19-6 | Calculated B(E2)out/B(E2)in ratios agree with the available experimental values within uncertainties and vary approximately as tan-squared(gamma); the large interband E2 strength is treated as a collective wobbling fingerprint, not as a sufficient model-independent proof. | model-calculation / experimental-criterion | direct | PDF p. 3, Table I and text below Fig. 1 | true |
| CH19-7 | The calculated B(M1)out/B(E2)in values are somewhat larger than experiment; with two high-j protons the ratio is larger than in one-quasiparticle odd-A examples, so the E2 fraction of the Delta-I = 1 transition is smaller and does not dominate as strongly. | model-calculation / limitation | direct | PDF pp. 2-3, Table I and transition-strength discussion | true |
| CH19-8 | PRM angular-momentum distributions for S1 and S1-prime are centered in the short-medium plane, with a symmetric n = 0 distribution and an antisymmetric n = 1 distribution; the authors interpret the stable rim and short-axis proton alignment as a two-quasiparticle transverse-wobbling geometry. | model-calculation / author-interpretation | direct | PDF pp. 3-4, Figs. 2-3 | true |
| CH19-9 | The calculated n = 2 and n = 3 candidates show additional nodes and wider precession cones, while their interband E2 and M1 strengths grow more slowly than the harmonic n scaling and Delta-n = 2 transitions remain suppressed. | model-calculation | direct | PDF p. 4, Fig. 4 and multiphonon discussion | true |
| CH19-10 | The authors distinguish the proposed wobbling connection from the higher AC configuration by its much smaller calculated connecting E2/M1 strengths; this is a PRM comparison and does not by itself exclude all signature-partner alternatives. | model-calculation / competing-interpretation criterion | direct | PDF p. 4, AC-band paragraph and Fig. 4 | true |
| CH19-11 | The paper concludes that S1-prime is the first proposed two-quasiparticle transverse-wobbling band in an even-even nucleus and calls this the most stable transverse-wobbling case known at publication time; this is the authors' synthesis of experimental inputs and model calculations. | author-interpretation | direct | PDF pp. 1 and 4, Abstract and Summary | true |

## Analytical Reconstruction

The evidence chain is deliberately layered: prior gamma spectroscopy supplies bands, angular-distribution mixing ratios and reduced-transition ratios; CDFT/TAC supplies a plausible triaxial two-proton configuration; PRM tests whether the same inputs generate decreasing wobbling energy, collective interband E2 strength and the expected angular-momentum topology. The two-solution delta ambiguity is an explicit gate: adopting the small solution is a choice supported by chi-squared ranking, not a unique experimental determination.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- The source is a theory paper using prior `130Ba` spectroscopy, not a new transition measurement.
- The adopted small-|delta| solution is not unique from angular distributions alone.
- CDFT deformation, spin-dependent MoI and PRM geometry are model inputs; signature-partner alternatives remain a reverse test.

## Assumptions, Limits and Reverse Tests

- The source is a theory/model paper using prior experimental data. It should not replace the original `130Ba` spectroscopy source for transition energies, detector details or mixing-ratio extraction.
- Spin-dependent moments of inertia and a constrained CDFT shape are inputs to the PRM. A reverse test is to vary the deformation and MoI within the quoted ranges or compare a signature-partner/TPSM interpretation.
- Decreasing wobbling energy and strong E2 links are joint criteria; neither excludes a competing band explanation without independent configuration, polarization, lifetime or complete transition data.
- The adopted small-|delta| branch should be revisited if later angular-distribution, polarization or conversion data discriminate the second solution.

## Human Review Triage

P0:

1. **CH19-1/CH19-2, PDF pp. 1-2 and Table I.** Verify the reaction/beam details, the source of the angular-distribution data and the two-solution delta statement; this is essential for the evidence gate.
2. **CH19-5/CH19-6, PDF pp. 2-3, Fig. 1 and Table I.** Check the wobbling-energy definition, ratio directions and whether “evidence” is attributed to the PRM comparison.
3. **CH19-8/CH19-10, PDF pp. 3-4, Figs. 2-4.** Verify the angular-momentum geometry, multiphonon nodes and the distinction from the AC/signature-partner-like configuration.

P1:

- CH19-3/CH19-4: verify the CDFT/TAC deformation and fitted-MoI wording.
- CH19-7/CH19-9/CH19-11: check the quantitative M1 limitation and the strength of the publication-era “first example” wording.
