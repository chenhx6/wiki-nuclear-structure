# Evidence for Chiral Symmetry Breaking in `140Eu`?

## Bibliographic Record

Physical Review C 68, 054310 (2003), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevC.68.054310`. The question mark is part of the original title and is scientifically material: the paper ends with two unresolved interpretations rather than a discovery claim.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`.
- Covered scope: all 14 PDF pages, complete level scheme and transition table, coincidence spectra, angular-distribution/DCO/polarization calibrations, spin-parity and configuration arguments, alignments, TRS/Routhian and particle-rotor calculations, branching-ratio table, chirality/shape-coexistence alternatives and conclusion.
- Not covered: event-level matrices, efficiency/polarization calibration files, the earlier isomer-tagging and level-scheme papers, or independent lifetime data.
- Coverage caveats: several transitions/spins are tentative; the 20.5-keV Band-5 link is conjectural; branching ratios do not supply individual absolute `B(M1)` or `B(E2)` values.

## Extracted Pages

- PDF pp. 1-2: abstract, motivation, prior `140Eu` structures and experimental setup.
- PDF pp. 3-8: level scheme, spectra, Table I, angular-distribution/DCO/asymmetry methods and band-by-band placement.
- PDF pp. 9-11: TRS, alignments, configuration assignments, regional systematics and branching-ratio calculation.
- PDF pp. 12-13: possible chirality, missing signature partners, shape coexistence and conclusion.
- PDF p. 14: remaining references only.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

The authors test whether `140Eu` extends the `A≈130` chiral-candidate region beyond the `N=75` isotones. The same TRS calculations also predict two close triaxial minima near `β≈0.2, γ≈±25°`, so the experiment is explicitly framed as a discrimination problem between chiral twins and shape coexistence (PDF pp. 1-2 / journal pp. 054310-1–2).

## Method and Design Logic

- High-statistics doubles and triples from `92Mo(51V,2pn)140Eu` establish five bands and their links. `Kα` x-ray coincidences and an excitation function constrain the isotope assignment (PDF pp. 2-8; Figs. 1-4; Table I).
- Gated angular distributions, DCO ratios and YRAST-Ball clover Compton asymmetry constrain transition multipolarity and electric/magnetic character. The paper defines `A=(N_parallel-N_perpendicular)/(N_parallel+N_perpendicular)`, so magnetic transitions have positive `A`; this convention must not be mixed with the opposite sign convention used in Hecht 2001 (PDF pp. 3-7; Figs. 5-7).
- Alignments, interband links and regional systematics motivate common-configuration assignments for Bands 1/2 and Bands 3/4. TRS, Woods-Saxon Routhians and a triaxial particle-rotor calculation then test possible intrinsic structures, while measured branchings supply only `B(M1)/B(E2)` ratios (PDF pp. 9-13; Figs. 9-13; Table II).

## Summary

The paper establishes a much expanded `140Eu` high-spin level scheme with five bands and 69 transitions. Bands 1/2 are assigned a mixed `π(g7/2,d5/2)⊗νh11/2` negative-parity configuration; Bands 3/4 are assigned `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` positive parity. Each pair has same-spin near-degenerate levels and can be discussed as a chiral-twin candidate, but TRS also supplies a viable same-configuration shape-coexistence scenario at `γ≈+25°` and `−25°`. Missing signature partners and the absence of lifetimes/absolute strengths prevent a decision.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

- `92Mo(51V,2pn)140Eu` at 205 MeV, selected after a 190–220 MeV excitation function; two stacked `700 μg/cm²` targets (PDF p. 2).
- Yale ESTU Tandem and YRAST Ball: seven segmented clovers at `90°`, 16 coaxial Ge at `50°/126°/160°`, and three LEPS at `50°/90°`; total photopeak efficiency about `2.5%` (PDF p. 2).
- Five-day run: about `1.0×10^9` unfolded doubles and `4.7×10^8` unfolded triples (PDF p. 2).
- TRS calculations predict two persistent minima around `β≈0.2, γ≈±25°` through `ℏω≈0.45 MeV`; particle-rotor calculations use `γ≈25°` for branching-ratio comparisons (PDF pp. 8-13; Figs. 9, 13).

## Key Results

| ID | Statement | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HE03-1 | The 205-MeV experiment produced about `1.0×10^9` unfolded doubles and `4.7×10^8` unfolded triples; x-ray coincidences and excitation-function behavior support assignment to `140Eu`. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF p. 2 / journal p. 054310-2 | true |
| HE03-2 | The new level scheme contains five bands and 69 transitions. | experimental-fact | direct | Abstract; PDF pp. 1, 13; Fig. 1; Table I | true |
| HE03-3 | Bands 1 and 2 are negative parity, linked by two E2 and two mixed M1/E2 transitions; Band 2 is new and changes from E2-dominated low spin to dipole-dominated decay after a crossing near `I≈12ℏ`. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp. 4, 7; Fig. 1 | true |
| HE03-4 | Bands 3 and 4 are positive parity and connected by E2 and mixed M1/E2 transitions; Band 4 is reconstructed from a previously reported side-feeding cascade. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp. 7-8; Fig. 1 | true |
| HE03-5 | Band 3 spins are revised upward by `2ℏ` relative to Ref. 17 using regional `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` systematics and a newly placed 71.0-keV `10+→9+` transition. | experimental-assignment | indirect | PDF pp. 7-8; Fig. 8 | true |
| HE03-6 | Band 5 contains three observed `ΔI=2` transitions, but its proposed 20.5-keV link is unobserved and inferred from coincidence and intensity ordering; the band interpretation is unclear. | experimental-fact | indirect | PDF p. 8; Fig. 1 | true |
| HE03-7 | The paper's gated angular-distribution, DCO and asymmetry calibrations support the assigned dipole/quadrupole and electric/magnetic characters in Table I. | experimental-criterion | direct | PDF pp. 3-7; Figs. 5-7; Table I | true |
| HE03-8 | Bands 1 and 2 are assigned the same mixed `π(g7/2,d5/2)⊗νh11/2` configuration; treating either proton orbital as pure is explicitly considered misleading because of mixing. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp. 9, 13; Fig. 10(a) | true |
| HE03-9 | Bands 3 and 4 are assigned the same `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` configuration from linking-transition character, selection-rule reasoning, initial alignment near `7ℏ` and regional systematics. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp. 8, 10-11; Figs. 10(b), 12 | true |
| HE03-10 | Same-spin levels in Bands 3/4 differ by about `30 keV` at `13ℏ` and `15ℏ` and about `140 keV` at `11ℏ` and `17ℏ`; the authors therefore propose Band 4 as a possible chiral partner of Band 3. | author-interpretation | direct | PDF pp. 11-12 | true |
| HE03-11 | Same-spin levels in Bands 1/2 differ by about `110 keV` at `6−` and `8−` and about `10 keV` at `10−`; their chiral-partner interpretation is explicitly described as speculative. | author-interpretation | direct | PDF p. 12 | true |
| HE03-12 | The lack of observed signature partners for Bands 2 and 4 is a problem for the chiral interpretation, though rough intensity estimates allow that sequences near the `≈5%` relative-intensity level could have been missed. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p. 12 | true |
| HE03-13 | TRS calculations give two close, persistent minima around `β≈0.2, γ≈±25°` for reasonable positive- and negative-parity configurations. | model-result | indirect | PDF pp. 8-9, 12-13; Fig. 9 | true |
| HE03-14 | The two minima allow Bands 1/2 and Bands 3/4 to be interpreted instead as same-configuration bands at different triaxial shapes; the data do not choose this shape-coexistence scenario over chirality. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp. 12-13 | true |
| HE03-15 | Branching-derived `B(M1)/B(E2)` values agree reasonably with the particle-rotor calculation for Band 3 above `I=13ℏ` but disagree strongly for Band 1; no individual absolute strengths were measured. | model-result | direct | PDF p. 11; Fig. 13; Table II | true |
| HE03-16 | The authors identify lifetime measurements as the discriminator: chirality predicts a sharp intraband `B(E2)` change near `I≈15ℏ`, whereas shape coexistence predicts a smoother increase. | author-interpretation | direct | PDF p. 13, Conclusion | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

| Structure | Observed relation | Paper assignment | Calibrated status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bands 1/2 | linked negative-parity structures; near-degenerate same-spin states; different crossing behavior | mixed `π(g7/2,d5/2)⊗νh11/2` | possible chiral twins or same-configuration shape coexistence |
| Bands 3/4 | linked positive-parity structures; near-degenerate same-spin states; related alignments | `πh11/2⊗νh11/2` | stronger of the two chiral candidates, but shape coexistence remains viable |
| Band 5 | three `ΔI=2` transitions; connection depends on an unobserved 20.5-keV transition | unclear | incomplete structure, not a chiral candidate in this source |

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

- Chirality and shape coexistence are co-primary interpretations in the paper; neither is a later Agent-added objection.
- A same orbital label is inferred through links, alignments, systematics and selection rules, not measured by a configuration-specific observable.
- Missing signature partners weaken both scenarios and are rescued only by rough sensitivity estimates.
- Particle-rotor comparison uses branching-derived ratios. Without lifetimes, the sharp-versus-smooth `B(E2)` prediction is untested.
- Band 1 disagrees with the calculation, plausibly because of proton-orbital mixing; Band 5 remains unexplained.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | Audit item | Agent judgment | Evidence / locator | review_status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AR-1 | Core reconstruction | The paper establishes two linked same-configuration candidate pairs, but its scientific result is an unresolved chirality-versus-shape-coexistence dilemma, not evidence uniquely selecting chirality. | HE03-3 to HE03-16; Abstract and Conclusion | unreviewed |
| AR-2 | Assumptions and dependencies | Absolute spins, configuration purity, missed-signature sensitivity and TRS minima all introduce model/systematics dependencies. | HE03-5, HE03-8/9, HE03-12/13 | unreviewed |
| AR-3 | Transfer conditions | DCO, angular-distribution and asymmetry values are array/gate/convention specific; only the general calibration logic is transferable. | PDF pp. 3-7 | unreviewed |
| AR-4 | Failure conditions | Different configurations, observation of incompatible signature partners, or smooth absolute strengths inconsistent with the chiral prediction would break the proposed assignment chain. | HE03-8 to HE03-16 | unreviewed |
| AR-5 | Reverse/falsification test | Measure level lifetimes and mixing ratios in both members of both pairs, extract absolute intraband/interband strengths, and compare chirality and two-minimum shape mixing on the same observable set. | HE03-15/16 | unreviewed |
| AR-6 | Research-question decision | Persist two separate candidate-pair pages and one experiment page; keep Band 5 source/nucleus-only until a later paper provides a stable identity. | Full paper | unreviewed |

### Companion Evidence Audit

- Five-band level scheme and 69 transitions: `observed` at publication level; event-level reanalysis is unavailable.
- Interband links for Bands 1/2 and 3/4: `observed`, with multipolarity/electromagnetic character constrained for selected strong links.
- Common configurations and intrinsic handedness: `expected-but-not-established`.
- Signature partners of Bands 2/4: `not-observed`; the sensitivity explanation is an author estimate.
- Band-5 20.5-keV link: `expected-but-not-established`.
- Lifetime discriminator: `not-measured` in this source.

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Existing Wiki understanding: early chiral candidates combine linked same-parity bands, configuration arguments and triaxial model support, but energy proximity is not unique.
- Effect of this source: `supports`, `limits`, and `competes-with`.
- Persistence decision: create a `140Eu` nucleus page, two candidate-pair pages and the Yale experiment page; add project claims that keep chirality and shape coexistence symmetric until later lifetime evidence is ingested.
- Review state: all HE03 claims and analytical reconstruction remain unreviewed and outside the paper evidence pool.

### P0

P0: none identified.

### P1

- **HE03-10 to HE03-16 and AR-1 — candidate strength and competing interpretation.** Grounded evidence: title includes a question mark, Abstract and Conclusion retain both chirality and shape coexistence. Agent inference: neither pair should be counted as confirmed chirality. User check: confirm equal visibility of the two scenarios. Risk: turning a discrimination paper into a discovery claim.
- **HE03-5/8/9 and AR-2 — spin/configuration inference.** Grounded evidence: Band 3 spins are revised by systematics and configuration assignments combine links, selection rules and alignments. Agent inference: common configuration remains indirect. User check: verify band crosswalk and configuration labels. Risk: unstable pair identity or circular systematics.
- **HE03-6/12 — absent or conjectural companions.** Grounded evidence: Bands 2/4 lack observed signature partners and Band 5 uses an unobserved 20.5-keV link. Agent inference: sensitivity estimates do not convert absence into observation. User check: preserve `not-observed`/`expected-but-not-established`. Risk: completing the level scheme in prose.
- **HE03-7 — asymmetry sign convention.** Grounded evidence: this paper defines parallel-minus-perpendicular and magnetic-positive, opposite to Hecht 2001's printed convention. User check: ensure later cross-source tables compare electromagnetic assignments, not raw sign. Risk: reversing electric/magnetic conclusions.

### P2/P3

- P2: verify the quoted pair splittings, YRAST Ball inventory, Band-3 spin revision and Table-II ratio characterization.
- P3: review aliases, page navigation and project placement before finalization.
