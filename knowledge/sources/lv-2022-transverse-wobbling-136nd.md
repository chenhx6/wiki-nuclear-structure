# Transverse wobbling bands in `136Nd`

## Bibliographic Record

PRC 105, 034302 (2022), DOI `10.1103/PhysRevC.105.034302`; the supplied PDF is a self-archived published version and matches the BibTeX record.

## Scope and Reading Depth

- Completed reading_depth: `deep-read`
- Covered scope: full published-version text, L1/L3 bands, contamination audit, combined `P-R_ac`, 751-keV `δ`, wobbling energy and new two-quasiparticle PRM.
- Not covered: earlier same-dataset papers' full experimental details and independent calculation.
- Coverage caveats: only one connecting transition permits a combined polarization/correlation mixing-ratio extraction.

## Paper Question and Scientific Motivation

- Author-explicit motivation: test the predicted two-quasiparticle transverse-wobbling assignment of bands L1/L3 in even-even `136Nd` using a clean connecting transition (PDF pp.1-2).

## Method and Design Logic

- Audit four links for contamination, combine polarization and two-point angular correlation for the 751-keV line, derive δ/E2 fraction, and compare E_wob and electromagnetic ratios with a two-quasiparticle PRM (PDF pp.2-5, Figs.1-5).

## Key Evidence and Reasoning Chain

- One clean mixed M1-dominated link + decreasing E_wob → necessary experimental support; two-quasiparticle PRM mapping → transverse interpretation; model electromagnetic parameters are normalized to the same single point.

## Summary

The paper reports necessary experimental evidence for a two-quasiparticle transverse-wobbling interpretation in even-even `136Nd`. Its link is M1-dominated (`19%` E2), explicitly differing from one-quasiparticle odd-A cases.

## Experimental or Theoretical Setup

High-statistics JuroGam II dataset from the previously documented `100Mo(40Ar,4n)136Nd` experiment. This paper refers setup details to earlier same-run publications and focuses on `R_DCO`, `R_ac` and polarization.

## Key Results

| ID | 陈述 | claim_kind | evidence_level | locator | needs_review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LV22-1 | Bands L1 and L3 are treated as predicted zero-/one-phonon candidates built on a two-quasiproton `πh11/2^2` configuration. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF pp.2-3, Fig.1 | true |
| LV22-2 | Four L3→L1 `ΔI=1` links are known, but contamination/weakness prevents polarization analysis for 768, 785 and 740 keV. | experimental-fact | direct | PDF pp.2-3 | true |
| LV22-3 | Combined polarization and `R_ac` for the clean 751-keV `17+→16+` link yields `δ=-0.48^{+0.13}_{-0.14}`, corresponding to about `19%` E2. | experimental-criterion | direct | PDF pp.3-4, Figs.2-3 | true |
| LV22-4 | The paper explicitly states the link is M1-dominated, unlike one-quasiparticle wobblers, because two aligned quasiprotons give larger M1 matrix elements. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.4 | true |
| LV22-5 | Experimental `E_wob` decreases with spin and is reproduced by a rigid two-quasiparticle PRM. | model-result | direct | PDF p.4, Fig.4 | true |
| LV22-6 | The E2 operator's second-order term is fixed to the single experimental `B(E2)_out/B(E2)_in` point; `g_eff/Q` is fitted to the 751-keV `δ`. | model-result | direct | PDF p.5, Fig.5 | true |
| LV22-7 | Authors conclude this is the second even-even transverse-wobbling case. | author-interpretation | indirect | PDF p.5, Summary | true |

## Nuclear Structure Information

L1/L3 are assigned as zero-/one-phonon bands on πh11/2². Three of four connecting transitions cannot support equivalent polarization analysis because of weakness/contamination.

## Authors' Interpretation

The authors explicitly argue that two-quasiparticle wobbling can have an M1-dominated link, unlike common odd-A one-quasiparticle criteria.

## Model Results

The rigid PRM reproduces E_wob and selected ratios, but second-order E2 and g_eff/Q parameters are fixed to the sole usable experimental transition point.

## Competing Interpretations and Limitations

The model normalizes key electromagnetic parameters to the only measured link/strength point and assumes rigid short-axis quasiparticle alignment; high-spin discrepancies are attributed to alignment depletion. The conventional “predominant E2” criterion is not transferable unchanged to this two-quasiparticle case.

## Analytical Reconstruction

| ID | 审核项 | Agent 判断 | Evidence / locator | 审核状态 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LV22-AR-1 | Core reconstruction | Direct evidence is one clean M1-dominated mixed link plus decreasing E_wob; two-quasiparticle wobbling geometry is model-dependent. | Key Results and Competing Interpretations above | unreviewed |
| LV22-AR-2 | Assumptions and dependencies | The adopted band identities, mixing-ratio branches, configuration assignments, and model inputs are valid within the stated measured range. | Method/results/model sections cited above | unreviewed |
| LV22-AR-3 | Transfer conditions | Transfer only the measured observables and their explicit conditions; do not transfer the author interpretation without equivalent link and configuration evidence. | Source scope and claim locators above | unreviewed |
| LV22-AR-4 | Failure conditions | Alternative branch, band identity, configuration, or model dependence can weaken the structural label even when the measured transitions remain valid. | Competing Interpretations and Limitations above | unreviewed |
| LV22-AR-5 | Reverse/falsification test | Obtain independent lifetimes/multipolarities or common-input competing-model tests targeted to the stated evidence gap. | Follow-up observables identified by the source/Agent | unreviewed |
| LV22-AR-6 | Research-question decision | Retain the source in the project/synthesis evidence map with the source-local review boundary explicit. | Whole-source assessment | unreviewed |

## Knowledge Impact and Learning Decision

- Existing Wiki understanding: The Wiki already contained the broader wobbling topic and related candidate map, but not this source in a complete source-local evidence and review structure.
- Effect of this source: supports
- Reason: Direct evidence is one clean M1-dominated mixed link plus decreasing E_wob; two-quasiparticle wobbling geometry is model-dependent.
- Persistence decision: project update / synthesis update
- Review state: page-level `human-reviewed`; Key Results claims remain `needs_review: true` for future claim-specific paper use.

## Human Review Triage

Review disposition: the user completed a rough page-level review on 2026-07-25 and accepted the current evidence-calibrated wording without correction. The P0/P1 items below are retained as future strict paper-use verification prompts, not unresolved ingest blockers.

### P0

- `LV22-3`/`LV22-4`, 751-keV link, Figs.2-3 — Evidence: δ≈-0.48 and only ~19% E2, so the clean link is M1 dominated. Agent inference: this is a configuration-specific exception, not support for a universal E2-dominant rule. User check: sign/uncertainty and contamination audit. Risk: mislabeling it E2 dominated reverses the experimental result.

### P1

- `LV22-6`, Fig.5 — Evidence: second-order E2 and g_eff/Q are fixed to the sole usable point. Agent inference: model agreement is not an independent multi-point prediction. User check: normalization procedure and remaining predictions. Risk: fitted reproduction may be overstated as validation.

### P2/P3

- P1: rigid alignment/high-spin depletion. P2/P3: metadata/navigation.

## Human Review Record

- 2026-07-25: the user completed a rough review of this source page and accepted its current claims, attribution boundaries, locators and stated limitations without requesting corrections.

## Review Status

Page-level review is complete for this ingest round. Claim-level `needs_review` and Analytical Reconstruction review markers remain unchanged because this was a rough review rather than exhaustive claim-by-claim paper certification.

## Non-source Notes and Follow-up
